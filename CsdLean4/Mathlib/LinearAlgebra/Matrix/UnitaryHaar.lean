# Haar measure on the matrix unitary group

**Category:** 1-Mathlib (CSD-free Mathlib smoke test).

This file verifies that Mathlib's Haar measure infrastructure
(`MeasureTheory.Measure.haar`) is callable on
`Matrix.unitaryGroup (Fin N) ℂ` once the topology/compactness/measurability
instances from `UnitaryCompact.lean` are in place.

## The chain

For `haar : Measure G` to typecheck, Lean needs:
1. `Group G` — Mathlib's `Matrix.unitaryGroup` is a `Group` (subgroup of units).
2. `TopologicalSpace G` — inherited from `Matrix _ _ ℂ` via the subtype topology.
3. `IsTopologicalGroup G` — Mathlib generic from `Topology/Algebra/Star/Unitary.lean`.
4. `MeasurableSpace G` — installed by `UnitaryCompact.instMeasurableSpace`.
5. `BorelSpace G` — installed by `UnitaryCompact.instBorelSpace`.
6. `LocallyCompactSpace G` — chains automatically: `CompactSpace`
   (`UnitaryCompact.instCompactSpace`) gives `WeaklyLocallyCompactSpace`
   (Mathlib priority-100 instance), which gives `LocallyCompactSpace`
   in the presence of `R1Space` (implied by `T2Space`, which the
   subtype inherits from `Matrix _ _ ℂ`).

## Verified

- `unitaryHaar : Measure (Matrix.unitaryGroup (Fin N) ℂ)` — the chosen
  Haar measure.
- `IsHaarMeasure unitaryHaar` — left-invariant + finite on compacts +
  positive on nonempty opens.
- `IsFiniteMeasure unitaryHaar` — the whole space is compact, so the
  Haar measure is finite.

## What this unlocks

With Mathlib's Haar measure callable, the next steps for LF4 are
normalisation to a probability measure (deferred to a follow-up
tranche) and the Fubini-Study pushforward to `ℂℙ^{N-1}`.

/-! ## Smoke-test usage

Confirms that the typeclass chain (CompactSpace → WeaklyLocallyCompactSpace
→ LocallyCompactSpace given T2; plus IsTopologicalGroup, MeasurableSpace,
BorelSpace) fires correctly. The four examples below all elaborate via
`inferInstance`; each is a witness that Lean can synthesise the
corresponding fact about the Haar measure. -/

/-! ## Normalisation to a probability measure

`unitaryHaar` is finite (compact group) and gives positive mass to
the whole space (Haar measure on a nonempty open set is positive).
We can therefore rescale by `(unitaryHaar Set.univ)⁻¹` to obtain a
probability measure that is still Haar (Haar property is preserved
under positive finite scaling).

The resulting `unitaryHaarProb` is the canonical SU(N)-invariant
probability measure on the matrix unitary group, and the
ingredient that the Fubini-Study measure on `ℂℙ^{N-1}` will be
constructed from via pushforward (next tranche).

/-- The total mass `unitaryHaar Set.univ` is nonzero, because `Set.univ`
is a nonempty open set and Haar measure is `IsOpenPosMeasure`. -/

/-- The total mass `unitaryHaar Set.univ` is finite, because the group
is compact and Haar measure is `IsFiniteMeasureOnCompacts`. -/
