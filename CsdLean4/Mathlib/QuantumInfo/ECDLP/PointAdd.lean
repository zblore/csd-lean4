# Derived field-multiplication count for `a = 0` Jacobian mixed addition  (ECDLP Phase 2, Stage S6.2)

**Category:** 1-Mathlib (CSD-free; staged as a Mathlib-upstream candidate).

Sibling of S6.1 (`PointDouble.lean`). S6 of the ECDLP resource programme
(`specs/ecdlp-resource-plan.md`) "derives the free parameter `M`" — the number of register×register
field multiplications per elliptic-curve point operation. S6.1 derived the **doubling** count
`M_dbl = 8`; S6.2 derives the **mixed-addition** count `M_add`, replacing the documented EFD constant
`11`. The straight-line program model (`Instr`/`Program`/`evalProgram`/`mulCount`/`regGet`) is
**reused verbatim** from `PointDouble.lean`; only the schedule and its correctness theorem are new.

## The addition subtlety (why this is not a literal `addXYZ` count)

Mathlib's **raw** `WeierstrassCurve.Jacobian.addX P Q` (`Jacobian/Formula.lean:467`) carries a
`2·a₆·(P z)⁴·(Q z)⁴` term. secp256k1 has `a₆ = 7 ≠ 0`, so even under `a₁=a₂=a₃=a₄=0` the raw
representative is **not** the textbook EFD addition formula — it still contains the curve constant. The
raw and the clean EFD form agree only **on the curve**, where Mathlib eliminates the `a₆` term via the
curve equation (`addX_eq'`). We therefore count the **on-curve EFD-comparable** addition: the schedule a
real circuit pays, which assumes the inputs satisfy `Equation P`/`Equation Q` and never materialises the
`a₆` term. This is why `additionProgram_correct` carries `hP : W'.Equation P`, `hQ : W'.Equation Q` as
**load-bearing** hypotheses (satisfiable: points on the curve — see the `ZMod 17` witness below), unlike
the doubling schedule, whose `dblX`/`dblY` formulae are clean at `a = 0` without an on-curve hypothesis.

## The exhibited on-curve schedule

With the standard intermediates `U1 = P x·Q z²`, `U2 = Q x·P z²`, `S1 = P y·Q z³`, `S2 = Q y·P z³`,
`D = addZ = U1 − U2`, `r = S1 − S2`, the schedule computes the three numerators
```
out_X = r² − U1·D² − U2·D²
out_Y = r·(out_X − U1·D²) + S1·D³
out_Z = −(P z·Q z)·D
```
and (verified here by `ring` after rewriting `a = 0` into `addX_eq'`/`negAddY_eq'`) these are exactly the
components of `(−(P z·Q z)) • W'.addXYZ P Q` in Mathlib's weighted Jacobian action
`w • ![A,B,C] = ![w²·A, w³·B, w·C]`:
```
out_X = W'.addX    P Q · (P z·Q z)²    -- the addX_eq' RHS at a = 0           (consumes Equation P/Q)
out_Y = W'.negAddY P Q · (P z·Q z)³    -- = −(W'.addY P Q)·(P z·Q z)³ at a = 0 (consumes Equation P/Q)
out_Z = −(P z·Q z)·(addZ P Q)          -- pure `addZ` definition               (HYPOTHESIS-FREE)
```
i.e. `![out_X, out_Y, out_Z] = (−(P z·Q z)) • W'.addXYZ P Q`. Since `W'.addXYZ P Q` is Mathlib's
group-law representative of `P + Q` (`Jacobian/Point.lean`), the unit multiple `(−(P z·Q z)) • addXYZ`
(a unit when `P z, Q z ≠ 0`) represents the **same** group element. Note the asymmetry: `out_Z`'s
identity is hypothesis-free (it is the `addZ` definition up to the scalar), while `out_X`/`out_Y` consume
the curve equations — that asymmetry is precisely the `a₆`-elimination subtlety above.

## The carve line (which side each result sits on)

* **Group-law correctness is REUSED from Mathlib, not derived here.** `W'.addXYZ` represents `P + Q` in
  `Jacobian/Point.lean`; this module does not reprove the group law.
* **The on-curve polynomial identities are REUSED from Mathlib** via `addX_eq'` / `negAddY_eq'`; only the
  fact "the exhibited program *evaluates to those numerators*" is proved here (a `ring` step).
* **The count `M_add` is DERIVED here**, off the program's instruction list (`mulCount`), the same
  derived-cost discipline as S6.1 and the rest of the programme.
* **The full assembled point-addition reversible circuit is NOT built here** (register routing, ancilla
  scheduling, in-place modular reduction between multiplies). The resource bridge below composes the
  derived count with the verified per-multiply cost at the level of a bound; the concrete assembly is
  named **S6.3 residue**.

Honest comparison to the literature: the EFD `a = 0` mixed addition (`add-2007-bl`) is quoted at
`11M + 5S = 16`, and `add-1998-cmo-2` at `12M + 4S = 16`. This explicit, *verified* schedule lands at
`17`, one above those figures. The gap is two-fold and **not** fudged down: (a) the EFD schedules fold
the two `output − U1·D²` style subtractions and reuse `S1·D³` / `r·(…)` products in a way that shaves
one product via a Karatsuba-style `(U1+U2)`/`(S1+S2)` combination this straight-line schedule does not
exploit; (b) the explicit `out_Z = −(P z·Q z)·D` here pays a separate `P z·Q z` *and* `PzQz·D` product
(two opcodes) where EFD折叠s the `Z`-update into a single `((P z+Q z)² − P z² − Q z²)·D` step reusing the
already-computed `P z²`, `Q z²` (one product). The `mul`/`sq` opcodes here do not distinguish `M` from
`S` (both counted as one), matching S6.1's convention; the reported `17` is the count of the exhibited
on-curve schedule, comparable to — not claimed equal to — the EFD `16`. -/

/-- **The load-bearing S6.2 theorem.** Under the secp256k1 hypotheses `a₁=a₂=a₃=a₄=0` and the on-curve
hypotheses `hP : W'.Equation P`, `hQ : W'.Equation Q`, the addition program evaluated at the coordinates
`(P x, P y, Q x, Q y, P z, Q z)` produces, in registers `additionOutX/Y/Z`, the three components of the
projective representative `(−(P z·Q z)) • W'.addXYZ P Q` of `P + Q`:

* `out_X = W'.addX P Q · (P z·Q z)²`    (the `addX_eq'` RHS at `a = 0`; consumes `hP`, `hQ`);
* `out_Y = W'.negAddY P Q · (P z·Q z)³` (= `−(W'.addY P Q)·(P z·Q z)³` at `a = 0`; consumes `hP`, `hQ`);

load-bearing for the `X`/`Y` components (they eliminate the raw `2·a₆·(P z)⁴·(Q z)⁴` term, nonzero on
