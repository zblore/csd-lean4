# LF3 SectorSeparation: sector-state decomposition and pointer-leakage bounds

**Category:** 3-Local (LF3 sector-separated final state, per-wing pointer overlaps, leakage bound).

Paper §4 / §9.6. (Renamed from `BranchSeparation` in Phase 11, 2026-05-18,
to align with the volume-ratios reading: the four `(s, t)` regions are
eigensectors / volume domains, not Everettian branches.)

Defines the sector-separated final state, the per-wing pointer-overlap
observables, and the cross-sector readout mass; bundles the per-side leakage
parameters as `PointerLeakageBounds`; proves the sector-decomposition law
(definitional under `MeasurementUnitary.action`) and the operational
distinguishability bound.

The amplitude `cAmp : Sign → Sign → ℂ` is carried as an external parameter; the
concrete singlet amplitude is supplied later in `Singlet/State.lean` so the
import direction stays `SectorSeparation → Singlet/State`.

/-- Cross-sector readout mass is bounded by `εA + εB` given amplitude
    normalisation (paper §4.11). The proof sums the per-side leakage bounds
    weighted by `‖cAmp st‖²` and uses `∑ ‖cAmp st‖² ≤ 1`.

    **Disclosure-infrastructure status.** This theorem is standalone in
    the current Lean tree: no LF3 export consumes it. `LF3_finite_leakage_theorem`
    routes through the operator-form `LeakageCompat.sectorVolume_dev` field
    (in `Projectors/SectorVolume.lean`) instead, which is structurally a
    more direct bound on the quantity the chain capstones actually consume.
    The geometric `sector_separation_leakage_bound` here is kept as paper-side
    disclosure infrastructure: it makes the §4.11 inequality formally available
    even though the operator-form path supersedes it in the v1.00 chain. A v2
    refactor connecting the two would replace `LeakageCompat.sectorVolume_dev`
    with a derived form using this lemma plus a Cauchy-Schwarz step. Not
    scheduled for LF4. -/
