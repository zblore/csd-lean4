# LF3 Hamiltonian: tensor-factor readout algebra and measurement unitary

Paper §3 / §9.5. Abstract structural interfaces for the impulsive-readout
measurement model:

- `TensorFactorReadoutAlgebra` carries `hA`, `hB` and their commutation as a
  field. The local Hamiltonians are self-adjoint continuous linear maps.
- `MeasurementUnitary` carries a `LinearIsometryEquiv` triple `(u, uA, uB)`
  for the full and per-wing measurement unitaries (unitarity in the type),
  the factorisation law in pointwise form, and the eigenstate-action field
  encoding the impulsive-readout idealisation.

Per spec §9.5, the operator exponential is not constructed in v1.00; the
unitaries enter as structural data.

    spec §9.11.

    Self-adjointness is stated via the inner-product equation directly,
    matching the convention used in `BinaryPointerProjectors` (avoids the
    `Star` typeclass synthesis on `H_SA →L[ℂ] H_SA`). -/

/-- A measurement unitary, its single-wing factors, the factorisation law,
    and the action on joint spin/pointer eigenstates.

    **D4 / G6 disclosure.** Per spec §9.5: `u` / `uA` / `uB` are **not**
    derived from `exp(-iHt)` in v1.00. They are supplied as a
    `LinearIsometryEquiv` triple (unitarity is part of the type) satisfying
    the factorisation and eigenstate-action laws (paper §3.6–§3.7) as
    structural fields rather than as theorems. Together with the abstract
    `ProjectorAlgebra` (`LF3/Projectors/Core.lean`), this carries the
    composite-tensor-structure debt D4 / G6 in Lean form.

    **v2 derivation target, partial.** The factorisation field
    `factorises : ∀ x, u x = uA (uB x)` is feasible by the same
    `TensorEmbedding K_A K_B H_SA` route used for `ProjectorAlgebra` in
    `LF3/Projectors/TensorModel.lean`, extended with per-wing unitaries
    `vA : K_A ≃ₗᵢ[ℂ] K_A`, `vB : K_B ≃ₗᵢ[ℂ] K_B` and a unitary-preserving
    extension of `liftA`, `liftB`. This is an immediate follow-up to the
    TensorModel module and remains scheduled. The eigenstate-action field
    `action`, encoding the impulsive-readout idealisation, requires
    `exp(-iHt)` machinery (operator exponential, Stone on bounded self-
    adjoint operators); spec §9.5 explicitly carves this out of v1.00 and
    LF4 or later is the natural home, gated on the operator-exponential
    pickup. -/
