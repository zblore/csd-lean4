# LF2 ↔ LF1 interface

**Category:** 3-Local (LF1 ↔ LF2 weight identity plus combined `LF1_main_theorem_projective` headline theorem).

Spec §6. The measure-theoretic identity linking the LF1 ontic weight
`μprep(π⁻¹(O))` to the LF2 projective weight `(π*μprep)(O)`.

This is the cleanest theorem in the LF2 stack: a single application of
`Measure.map_apply`. Its role is structural — it is the formal connection
point for `LF1_main_theorem_ae` to speak about projective outcome weights,
and the hinge by which LF2's measure bridge feeds back into the LF1 frequency
theorem.

/-! ### Projective-first outcome constructor

`SectorData.outcomeOfProjective` removes the caller burden in
`LF1_main_theorem_projective` and downstream chain capstones: given a
measurable projective region `Oep ⊆ P` and the **flow-projection
compatibility** hypothesis `∀ x, D.π (D.toOntic.Φ x) = D.π x` (CSD's
constraint-surface preservation reading — the ontic flow preserves
projective rays), the constructor returns an ontic `OutcomeRegion`
whose pre-event is exactly `D.π ⁻¹' Oep` and whose weight is the
projective weight of `Oep` under the LF2 measure bridge.

The Φ-π compatibility hypothesis is supplied as a constructor argument
rather than as a field on `SectorData` — adding a field would commit
all `SectorData` instances to the constraint-surface reading, which is
LF4 instantiation work. Keeping it on the constructor lets the
projective-first outcome family be built at the LF3 chain capstone with
a single CSD-foundational hypothesis. -/

/-- **Projective-first outcome constructor.** Given a measurable
    projective region `Oep ⊆ P` and the flow-projection compatibility
    hypothesis `h_flow_π : ∀ x, D.π (D.toOntic.Φ x) = D.π x`, returns the
    ontic `OutcomeRegion` with `Ω := D.π ⁻¹' Oep`. The companion lemmas
    `outcomeOfProjective_preEvent` and
    `outcomeOfProjective_weight_eq_projectiveWeight` give the projective-
    side reformulations of `preEvent` and `weight` respectively. -/

/-- **Combined LF1 + LF2 main theorem.**  Under the LF1 repeated-trial model
    and an LF2 sector structure with projection `π`, if an LF1 outcome
    region's pre-event coincides with the `π`-preimage of a projective
    outcome region `Oep`, then the empirical frequency converges almost
    surely to the (real-valued) **projective weight** of `Oep` under the
    pushforward of the preparation measure.

    This is the theorem-level consumption of LF1 by LF2: it shows that the
    LF1 limit is not merely an ontic volume fraction but can be reinterpreted
    natively in the projective measurable space that LF2 introduces.  No new
    mathematical content beyond LF1 + the LF2 interface identity — the point
    is the combined statement.

    A full Born-form conclusion (`‖⟨ψ, φ⟩‖²`) would require an additional
    spec-layer correspondence between measure-theoretic projective
    preparations and Hilbert-space unit vectors, which LF2 does not
    formalise.  See spec §6.4 and §8.5. -/
