# LF2 ↔ LF1 interface

**Category:** 3-Local (LF1 ↔ LF2 weight identity plus combined `LF1_main_theorem_projective` headline theorem).

Spec §6. The measure-theoretic identity linking the LF1 ontic weight
`μprep(π⁻¹(O))` to the LF2 projective weight `(π*μprep)(O)`.

This is the cleanest theorem in the LF2 stack: a single application of
`Measure.map_apply`. Its role is structural — it is the formal connection
point for `LF1_main_theorem_ae` to speak about projective outcome weights,
and the hinge by which LF2's measure bridge feeds back into the LF1 frequency
theorem.

/-! ### Projective-first outcome constructor

`SectorData.outcomeOfProjective` builds an LF1 ontic `OutcomeRegion`
from a measurable projective region `Oep ⊆ P` by taking the `π`-preimage:
`Ω := D.π ⁻¹' Oep`. The constructor itself requires only measurability
of `Oep`.

The **flow-projection compatibility** hypothesis
`∀ x, D.π (D.toOntic.Φ x) = D.π x` (CSD's constraint-surface
preservation reading — the ontic flow preserves projective rays) is
**not** consumed by the constructor itself. It is consumed by the
companion lemma `outcomeOfProjective_preEvent` to identify
`preEvent = Ω` (i.e. to fold the LF1 one-step-ahead pullback into the
plain preimage), which is what `LF1_main_theorem_projective` and the
LF3 chain capstones need.

Architectural rationale: the Φ-π compatibility hypothesis is supplied
as a *lemma* argument rather than as a field on `SectorData` —
adding a field would commit all `SectorData` instances to the
constraint-surface reading, which is LF4 instantiation work. Keeping
it on the per-lemma side lets the projective-first outcome family be
built at the LF3 chain capstone with a single CSD-foundational
hypothesis. -/

/-- **Projective-first outcome constructor.** Given a measurable
    projective region `Oep ⊆ P`, returns the ontic `OutcomeRegion`
    with `Ω := D.π ⁻¹' Oep`. The constructor requires only `hOep`;
    flow-projection compatibility is consumed by the companion lemma
    `outcomeOfProjective_preEvent`, which identifies `preEvent = Ω`.
    The companion lemma `outcomeOfProjective_weight_eq_projectiveWeight`
    gives the projective-side reformulation of the LF1 outcome weight. -/

/-- **Combined LF1 + LF2 main theorem.**  Under the LF1 repeated-trial model
    and an LF2 sector structure with projection `π`, if an LF1 outcome
    region's pre-event coincides with the `π`-preimage of a projective
    outcome region `Oep`, then the empirical frequency converges almost
    surely to the (real-valued) **projective weight** of `Oep` under the
    pushforward of the preparation measure.

    This is the theorem-level consumption of LF1 by LF2: it shows that the
    LF1 limit is not merely an ontic volume fraction but can be reinterpreted
    natively in the projective measurable space that LF2 introduces.  No new
    mathematical content beyond LF1 + the LF2 interface identity — the point
    is the combined statement.

    A full Born-form conclusion (`‖⟨ψ, φ⟩‖²`) would require an additional
    spec-layer correspondence between measure-theoretic projective
    preparations and Hilbert-space unit vectors, which LF2 does not
    formalise.  See spec §6.4 and §8.5. -/
