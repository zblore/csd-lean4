# LF2 Setup: Sector data

**Category:** 3-Local (LF2 `SectorData`: LF1 `OnticSetup` plus projective target, projection, and group action).

Extends the LF1 `OnticSetup` with:

- a measurable projection `π : Σ → P` onto an abstract epistemic measurable
  space (standing in for `CP^{N-1}`);
- a group `G` acting measurably on both `Σ` and `P`;
- the compatibility hypotheses (`μL`-invariance of the ontic action and
  `G`-equivariance of `π`) that drive the LF2 measure bridge.

The projective space is left abstract — no `Projectivization`, no Fubini–Study
measure construction. Concrete instantiation is LF4+'s job. The reference
measure `μFS` is not a field of `SectorData`; it enters downstream theorems as
an explicit argument, keeping `SectorData` `μFS`-agnostic.

/-- LF2 sector data. Groups the LF1 ontic setup together with the epistemic
    projection `π` and a `G`-action satisfying `μL`-invariance and
    `π`-equivariance.

    **A5 structural data, not a derivation.** Both `π : SigmaSpace → P` and the
    group `G` are taken as structural inputs. Nothing in `SectorData` constrains
    `π` to project onto the quantum-effective sector specifically: any
    measurable map with the two coherence conditions
    (`μL`-invariance of the ontic action, `π`-equivariance) qualifies.
    Similarly, `G` is any group acting measurably on both spaces with the two
    coherence conditions. The natural reading is `G = SU(N)` acting on `Σ` via
    the lift of its action on `CP^{N-1}`, with `π` the standard projection,
    but no field forces this.

    This labelling carries A5 in Paper B's framing: the physical motivation
    for the quantum-effective sector assumption is a load-bearing external
    input to the corpus, not derived in v1.00. Concrete instantiation
    (`P := Projectivization ℂ (EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin N))`,
    `G := Matrix.specialUnitaryGroup (Fin N) ℂ`, plus the explicit `π`) is
    deferred to LF4-todo §8. -/
