# LF4 Tranche A: a non-trivial measure-preserving flow on the Kähler instance

**Category:** 3-Local (a non-trivial measure-preserving flow on the Kähler instance).

Every concrete `SectorData` built so far (`LF4/Instance.lean`,
`LF4/KahlerInstance.lean`, `Tests/Examples.lean`) hard-codes `Φ := id`, so the
LF1 deterministic-typicality theorem, when instantiated, runs the strong law
over i.i.d. preparation draws with **no ontic evolution**. The `hΦ_pres`
(Liouville preservation) field is consumed only via its measurability content;
its preservation payload has never been load-bearing (see `LF1/Setup.lean`).

This module installs the first **non-trivial** deterministic flow on the
existing Kähler space `KSigma N = ℂℙ^{N-1} × T²`: a constant translation
`kFlow sh : (p, t) ↦ (p, sh + t)` on the `T²` fibre. It is measure-preserving
for `kMuL = μFS ⊗ vol_{T²}` because the fibre volume is the (translation-
invariant) Haar measure on `AddCircle 1 × AddCircle 1`, and it acts trivially on
the base. The frequency capstone `kFlow_frequency_convergence` fires the
law-agnostic LF1 theorem `freq_tendsto_of_iid` on the **evolved** trials
`kFlow sh ∘ sampleₙ`, and the measure-preservation of `kFlow` is exactly what
pins `law(kFlow sh ∘ sampleₙ) = kMuL p₀`, hence the limiting frequency to the
volume ratio `(kMuL O).toReal`. So `hΦ_pres` is load-bearing here for the first
time.

## What this does and does not establish

- **Does:** exhibits `Φ ≠ id` on a genuinely compact-Kähler `Σ`, makes the LF1
  deterministic structure non-vacuous on a concrete instance, and shows the
  ontic volume ratio is *stable under deterministic evolution* — the structural
  role Sigma0 §2.4 assigns to `(Φ_t)∗ μL = μL`. The flow preserves projective
  rays (`kFlow_preserves_rays`: `(kFlow sh p).1 = p.1`, i.e. `π ∘ kFlow = π`
  since `(kSectorData _).π = Prod.fst`), matching CSD's constraint-surface
  reading — the flow moves only within a fibre over a fixed quantum state `[ψ]`.
- **Does not:** escape the carve-out. The limit `(kMuL O).toReal` is the chosen
  volume of `O`; a translation flow has Haar as its invariant measure, so even
  with Birkhoff the space-average is the carved measure. Deriving the outcome
  *region* (and hence its Born weight) from the dynamics is Tranche B
  (`specs/carve-out-plan.md` §4, the §9.5 / G3b target), not this module.

common law `kMuL p₀`, the empirical frequency of a measurable outcome region `O`
evaluated on the **evolved** states `kFlow sh ∘ sampleₙ` converges almost surely
to the ontic volume ratio `(kMuL p₀ O).toReal`.

The deterministic flow `kFlow sh` (non-trivial for `sh ≠ 0`, by `kFlow_ne_id`) is
applied to every sampled microstate, and `kFlow_measurePreserving` is what makes
`law(kFlow sh ∘ sampleₙ) = kMuL p₀`, hence pins the limit to the volume ratio.
This is the LF1 deterministic-typicality theorem realised with a genuine flow on
a compact-Kähler `Σ`. -/

/-! ## D1c-1: the concrete Kähler `SectorData` with `Φ = kFlow ≠ id`

Every concrete `SectorData` shipped so far (`cpSectorData`, `kSectorData`)
hard-codes `Φ := id` in its underlying `OnticSetup`, leaving the standing
structural debt: the corpus has a genuine measure-preserving non-identity flow
(`kFlow`, above) but no concrete `SectorData` *carrying* it. This block
discharges that debt for the Kähler instance by rebuilding `kOnticSetup` /
`kSectorData` with `Φ := kFlow sh`.

Only the three flow-related `OnticSetup` fields change (`Φ`, `hΦ_pres`, and the
derived `measurable_Φ`); `μL`, `Ω0`, and their hypotheses are reused verbatim.
The `SectorData` `G`-action fields (`measurable_smul_σ`, `measurable_smul_P`,
`hμL_inv`, `hπ_equiv`) are about the `U(N)`-action and `π = Prod.fst`, never
about `Φ`, so they are reused verbatim from `kSectorData` (`hμL_inv` reads
`toOntic.μL`, which is unchanged `= kMuL p₀`).

**Honest scope.** `kFlow` is a *free* `T²`-fibre translation: a genuine
measure-preserving `Φ ≠ id`, but dynamically trivial — it is **not** a
measurement / de-isolation flow (LF5's `Φ_vN`), nor a symplectic / Hamiltonian
flow generated by the Kähler form. So this is the **structural** discharge of
the "`Φ = id` in the concrete Kähler instance" debt, not its physical content.
Deferred (D1c-2): threading a de-isolation or Hamiltonian flow as the instance's
`Φ`. **A5 is untouched** — D1c is necessary-but-not-sufficient for deriving the
sector + Fubini–Study typicality from the dynamics (A5 additionally needs the
flow ergodic / mixing to force `μFS`). `cpSectorData` still carries `Φ = id`;
only the Kähler instance is addressed here. -/

Identical to `kOnticSetup p₀` except for the three flow fields: `Φ` is the fibre

discharged. Reuses `kFlow_ne_id`. -/

/-- **Non-vacuity link to LF1.** The LF1 deterministic-typicality theorem is
non-vacuous on `kSectorDataFlow`: for i.i.d. preparation draws, the empirical
frequency of a measurable outcome region `O` evaluated on the states evolved by
the **instance's own flow** `(kSectorDataFlow p₀ sh).toOntic.Φ` converges almost
surely to the ontic volume ratio `(kMuL p₀ O).toReal`. This is just
`kFlow_frequency_convergence` stated through the instance (`Φ = kFlow sh` is
definitional), so the moving flow that pins the limit is the `SectorData`'s own
`Φ ≠ id`, not the identity. LF1 is cited, not re-proved. -/
