# Moving up the chain: the Kähler-sector VOLUME is forced, not posited

**Category:** 3-Local (the Kähler-sector VOLUME is forced, not posited).

`KahlerOnticSetup` carries two abstract-placeholder pairs (see `KahlerOnticSetup.lean`):

* `IsKahlerSector` / `kahler_condition` — "`Σ` has a closed 2-form `ω` compatible with a complex
  structure `J`". Genuinely **blocked**: Mathlib has no symplectic/Kähler-form API (KG-1 / link L1).
  Stays an honest `True` posit; nothing here changes that.
* `IsLiouvilleKahlerVolume` / `liouville_eq_kahler_volume` — "`liouvilleMeasure` is the top-power
  Kähler volume `ω^{∧n}/n!`". Until now its only formalised content was the *normalisation* core
  (`IsProbabilityMeasure`, fix C5). **This module upgrades that content** from "it is *a* probability
  measure" to "it is *the* volume forced by the space and its symmetry".

## The upgrade — `IsForcedKahlerVolume`

On the ray space `ℂℙ^{N-1}` the top-power Kähler volume is not a free choice: `ℂℙ^{N-1}` is the
compact homogeneous space `U(N)/(U(1)×U(N-1))`, and its Riemannian/symplectic (Fubini–Study) volume is
**the unique `U(N)`-invariant probability measure**. That uniqueness is already proved axiom-free
(`fubiniStudyMeasure_unique`). So we bundle the intrinsic characterisation

    IsForcedKahlerVolume μ  :=  (μ a probability measure)
                             ∧ (μ is U(N)-invariant)
                             ∧ (μ is the UNIQUE such measure),

and prove `fubiniStudyMeasure` satisfies it (`fubiniStudyMeasure_isForcedKahlerVolume`). This is the
measure-theoretic content of "`μ = ω^{∧n}/n!`": the Kähler volume is **determined by `Σ` and its
`U(N)`-symmetry**, an *outcome* of the space, not posited data. It is exactly the physically
load-bearing half of the Kähler posit — the volume is what the Born reading (typicality = volume
ratio) consumes; the differential-geometric 2-form packaging is the part that stays blocked (KG-1).

## Delivered on the concrete sectors

* `unitaryFlowSetup_liouville_isForcedKahlerVolume` — the `π = id` sector's Liouville measure (`= μ_FS`)
  IS the forced Kähler volume: the sector's volume is fully determined, not chosen.
* `manyToOneSetup_baseVolume_isForcedKahlerVolume` — on the genuine many-to-one Kähler instance
  `Σ = ℂℙ^{N-1} × T²`, the ray-space volume `π_*(liouvilleMeasure)` (the Kähler volume of the base
  that the Born rule scores) is the forced FS volume.
* `manyToOneSetup_liouville_eq_product` — the full `Σ`-volume `kMuL = μ_FS ⊗ vol_{T²}` is exhibited as
  the product of the two canonical invariant volumes (the forced FS volume on the base, Haar on the
  fibre) — so the whole Liouville measure is built from forced factor volumes.

## Honest scope

This discharges the **formalisable core** of `IsLiouvilleKahlerVolume` (volume forced by symmetry),
not the full differential-geometric `IsKahlerSector` (the 2-form), which remains Mathlib-blocked. And
it is FORWARD: it characterises the *posited* sector volume intrinsically; it does NOT derive the
`U(N)`-symmetry itself from the deterministic dynamics (that reverse — deriving `G` — is SL-1,
untouched). "The volume is forced by the symmetry" still takes the symmetry `G = U(N)` as given.

/-- **The Kähler volume, characterised intrinsically.** A measure `μ` on the ray space `ℂℙ^{N-1}` is
the *forced* Kähler/Liouville volume when it is a `U(N)`-invariant probability measure AND the UNIQUE
such measure. On the compact homogeneous space `ℂℙ^{N-1} = U(N)/(U(1)×U(N-1))` this pins `μ` to the
Fubini–Study volume with no free choice — the measure-theoretic content of "`μ = ω^{∧n}/n!`", an
outcome of the space and its symmetry rather than posited data. -/
