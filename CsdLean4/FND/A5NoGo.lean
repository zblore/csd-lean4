# FND/A5NoGo: the single-flow limit — a deterministic flow does not pin the sector

**Category:** 7-FND (the Choice A ontology layer).

The localized A5 result (`FND/LocalisedTypicality.lean`) shows the typicality measure is forced by the
`U(N)` SYMMETRY. This module makes precise WHY the *universal* A5 — deriving the Born measure `μ_FS` from
a single deterministic flow — is not reachable: **a single projective flow does not uniquely determine an
invariant measure**, so it cannot single out `μ_FS`.

The mechanism: a fixed ray of the flow supports an invariant Dirac measure. A projective unitary flow
with two DISTINCT fixed rays therefore has (at least) two distinct invariant probability measures — so
its invariant measure is not unique, and at least one of them is not `μ_FS`
(`flow_admits_invariant_ne_fubiniStudy`). Since a projective flow with an eigen-ray always has such
Diracs, and every unitary on `ℂ^N` (`N ≥ 2`) has orthogonal eigen-rays (spectral theorem), the
conclusion is generic; `phaseFlip_admits_invariant_ne_fubiniStudy` exhibits it on a concrete NON-trivial
flow (the phase-flip `diag(1,-1)` on `ℂℙ¹`).

## What this establishes

`μ_FS` is invariant under the flow (`fubiniStudyMeasure_smul_invariant`), but it is NOT distinguished
among the flow's invariant measures — the flow admits others. So "A5 is posited" is not a temporary
formalisation gap but a proved statement about the limit: the deterministic flow underdetermines the
sector's typicality measure. Pinning `μ_FS` needs the full `U(N)` symmetry (`IsForcedKahlerVolume`'s
uniqueness), which a single one-parameter flow does not carry. This matches Paper C (§1.4): `Σ`, `π`, the
A5 sector are assumed, not derived.

/-- **The single-flow limit (no-go for universal A5).** If a projective unitary flow `x ↦ V • x` fixes
two DISTINCT rays `p ≠ q`, it admits an invariant probability measure that is NOT the Fubini–Study /
Born measure. The two fixed-ray Diracs are both invariant and distinct, so at least one differs from
`μ_FS`. Hence the flow does not uniquely determine the sector's typicality measure. -/
