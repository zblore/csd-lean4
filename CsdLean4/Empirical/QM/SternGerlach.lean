# Empirical: Stern-Gerlach Born probabilities (spin-1/2)

**Category:** 3-Local. Foundational Born-probability example for a
single spin-1/2 system; QM-generic, no CSD ontology;
promotion-ready to 2-Framework on demand.

## What this file proves

The four canonical Born identities for a spin-1/2 system prepared in
the +1 eigenstate of `Z` (`|+_z⟩ = |0⟩`) and measured in either the
`Z` or `X` basis:

```
P(+_z | +_z) = 1          P(+_x | +_z) = 1/2
P(-_z | +_z) = 0          P(-_x | +_z) = 1/2
```

Plus the two **basis completeness** identities: probabilities sum to 1
across the outcomes of any single basis (this is the spectral
decomposition of unity for a complete projective measurement).

## Why Stern-Gerlach matters

The Stern-Gerlach experiment (Stern, Gerlach 1922) was the first
direct measurement of spatial quantisation of angular momentum.
A beam of silver atoms passed through an inhomogeneous magnetic field
splits into exactly two discrete beams — not a continuous distribution
— demonstrating that the projection of spin angular momentum along
any axis takes only two values, `±ℏ/2`.

The Born identities here are the QM-side predictions for the
**relative populations** observed in a sequential SG experiment:
prepare along `+z`, measure along `z` (one beam, all `+`); prepare
along `+z`, measure along `x` (two equal beams, 50/50). These are the
foundational tests of QM's probabilistic structure.

## Experimental verification

- Stern, Gerlach 1922: *Z. Phys.* **9**, 349 (original silver-atom beam).
- Phipps, Taylor 1927: *Phys. Rev.* **29**, 309 (hydrogen confirmation).
- Sakurai 1985 / Modern QM textbooks: SG as the canonical pedagogical
  illustration of QM measurement and basis-change.

## Distinction from other empirical content

- **Bell.lean / CHSH:** statistical inequalities for 2-party correlations.
- **GHZ.lean / Mermin-Peres:** algebraic LHV / contextuality.
- **Hardy.lean:** algebraic LHV for 2-party (with QM realisation).
- **Stern-Gerlach (this file):** **foundational single-particle Born**
  probabilities. The most basic QM prediction. No nonlocality, no
  contextuality — just `|⟨state|prep⟩|²` for a 2-dim system.

## Coding convention

Spin states are stored unnormalised as `Fin 2 → ℂ` (consistent with
`Hardy.lean`'s convention). `bornProb` divides through by the
norm-squared product, so any consistent (un)normalisation gives the
same Born probability.
