# TH4: Landauer's principle (the thermodynamic cost of erasure)

**Category:** conceptually 1-Mathlib (CSD-free general quantum statistical
mechanics) with a CSD reading; kept in the `CSD.Thermo` tree alongside TH1–TH3.

Landauer's principle: erasing information has an unavoidable thermodynamic cost.
In the information-theoretic (Reeb–Wolf) form, a system `S` coupled unitarily to
a bath `B` initially in the Gibbs state `τ_B = exp(-βH_B)/Z` at inverse
temperature `β` obeys

    `β · ΔQ ≥ S(ρ_S) − S(ρ_S')`,

where `ΔQ = ⟨H_B⟩_{ρ_B'} − ⟨H_B⟩_{τ_B}` is the heat dumped into the bath and
`ρ_S`, `ρ_S'` are the system's initial and final reduced states. The right side
is the entropy REMOVED from the system; the left is `β` times the dissipated
heat. Resetting a maximally-mixed bit (`S(ρ_S) = log 2`) to a definite value
(`S(ρ_S') = 0`) therefore costs `ΔQ ≥ T log 2 = kT ln 2` — Landauer's bound.

## The derivation (all from earlier tranches)

1. **Entropy conservation** (unitary + product): `S(ρ_SB') = S(ρ_S ⊗ τ_B) =
   S(ρ_S) + S(τ_B)`, via `vonNeumannEntropy_conj_unitary` (K1) and
   `vonNeumannEntropy_kronecker`.
2. **Subadditivity**: `S(ρ_SB') ≤ S(ρ_S') + S(ρ_B')`
   (`vonNeumannEntropy_subadditive`). With (1): `S(ρ_S) − S(ρ_S') ≤ S(ρ_B') −
   S(τ_B)`.
3. **Bath Clausius inequality**: `S(ρ_B') − S(τ_B) ≤ β·ΔQ`, i.e.
   `β·ΔQ − (S(ρ_B') − S(τ_B)) = D(ρ_B' ‖ τ_B) ≥ 0` (`relEntropy_nonneg`), using
   the Gibbs log identity `log τ_B = −βH_B − (log Z)·1` (TH3,
   `re_trace_mul_log_gibbs`).

Chaining (2) and (3) gives Landauer.

## Honest scope

The final marginals `ρ_S'`, `ρ_B'` are required positive-definite (full rank) —
the support hypothesis Klein/subadditivity need; physically the generic case.
The initial system state is taken positive-definite (so `ρ_S ⊗ τ_B` is; a
maximally-mixed bit qualifies). This is the standard finite-dimensional
Reeb–Wolf setting: a genuine bound, not the asymptotic/reversible idealisation.
As across the thermo track it is a QM-stat-mech theorem with a CSD reading;
the deterministic-microdynamics interpretation rests on the shared SO-1/D1 residue.

## Provenance

Foundational-triple only (`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`); no `sorry`,
no new axioms. Reuses K1 (`vonNeumannEntropy`, subadditivity), the Klein /
relative-entropy layer, and TH3 (`gibbsState`, `re_trace_mul_log_gibbs`);
nothing is re-proved.

/-! ## The Landauer bound -/

/-- **TH4 — Landauer's principle (Reeb–Wolf bound).** A system `S` (initial
state `ρ_S`, positive-definite) coupled by a global unitary `U` to a bath `B`
initially in the Gibbs state `τ_B = exp(-βH_B)/Z` at inverse temperature
`β > 0`, with full-rank final marginals, obeys

    `S(ρ_S) − S(ρ_S') ≤ β · (⟨H_B⟩_{ρ_B'} − ⟨H_B⟩_{τ_B})`.

The left side is the entropy REMOVED from the system by the process; the right
is `β` times the heat `ΔQ` dumped into the bath. Erasing information (decreasing
`S(ρ_S)` towards a definite state) therefore forces a proportional heat cost —
Landauer's principle. Proof: entropy conservation (unitary + product)
+ subadditivity give `S(ρ_S) − S(ρ_S') ≤ S(ρ_B') − S(τ_B)`; the bath Clausius
inequality bounds the latter by `β·ΔQ`. -/

/-! ## The one-bit corollary: `ΔQ ≥ T log 2` -/

/-- **Landauer's `kT ln 2` bound for erasing one bit.** If the system is a single
qubit initially maximally mixed (`S(ρ_S) = log 2`) and the erasure resets it to a
definite (pure) state (`S(ρ_S') = 0`), the heat dumped into the bath satisfies

    `log 2 ≤ β · ΔQ`,   equivalently   `ΔQ ≥ T · log 2 = kT ln 2`.

Stated as a consequence of `landauer_bound` given the two entropy end-points:
the entropy removed is exactly `log 2`, so the dissipated heat is at least
`T log 2`. -/
