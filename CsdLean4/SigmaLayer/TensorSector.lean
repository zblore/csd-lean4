# SigmaLayer/TensorSector: weaving the tensor product into the ledger

**Category:** 7-SigmaLayer (the projective-sector layer (Paper C)).

How the composite/tensor structure sits in the base. The honest split is:

* **Derived (theorems, NOT posits).** The finite tensor product `ℂ^{NA} ⊗ ℂ^{NB}` is a genuine,
  constructible object: it is the projective sector on the PRODUCT index `Fin NA × Fin NB`, identified with
  `Fin (NA · NB)` by `finProdFinEquiv` (`tensorIndexEquiv`). On it the local operator algebra is real:
  Alice's `U ⊗ I` and Bob's `I ⊗ Q` commute (`aliceOp_bobOp_commute`), and Alice cannot signal to Bob
  (the operator-level no-signalling `CSD.Empirical.QM.NoCommunication.no_communication`). None of this is
  assumed; it follows from the Kronecker algebra.

* **Bridge B6 (dim `= NA·NB`) — now DERIVABLE, still a structure field here.** The reconstruction claim
  that a composite's projective sector IS this tensor sector with `dim = NA · NB` is
  `CompositeSector.tensor_dimension`, a named field. As of 2026-07-17 it is no longer *parked*: the
  abstract theorem `CSD.SigmaLayer.compositeAlgReconstruction` (`SigmaLayer/TensorReconstruction.lean`) PROVES that
  commuting local algebras `M_m, M_n` that GENERATE a composite `𝒜` force `𝒜 ≃ₐ M_m ⊗ M_n`, and
  `CSD.SigmaLayer.composite_dim_eq` derives `k = m·n` for `𝒜 = M_k` — i.e. B6's dimension relation is a THEOREM
  under locality + generation, and the interface now HAS the constructor:
  `CSD.SigmaLayer.CompositeSector.ofReconstruction` builds a `CompositeSector` whose `tensor_dimension` field is
  FILLED by `composite_dim_eq` (derived from commuting, generating local embeddings). So B6 is
  dischargeable — the by-hand entangled tier (singlet, GHZ, CGLMP on `Fin 2 × Fin 2`) still supplies the
  field directly per instance, but no longer must.

So tensors ARE woven in: the tensor product, its no-signalling algebra, the composite-is-tensor
reconstruction (`compositeAlgReconstruction`), AND the B6-discharging constructor
(`CompositeSector.ofReconstruction`) are all theorems/tools.

/-- **The finite tensor index equivalence.** `Fin NA × Fin NB ≃ Fin (NA · NB)` (`finProdFinEquiv`): the
joint projective sector `CP^{NA·NB−1}` is genuinely the tensor product `ℂ^{NA} ⊗ ℂ^{NB}`, realised on the
product index, not posited. -/

/-- **The composite dimension is the tensor-product index.** For any composite sector, the posited
dimension relation `NA · NB = Njoint` (B6) transports the tensor index equivalence to
`Fin NA × Fin NB ≃ Fin Njoint`: the joint sector index IS the pair of party indices. This exhibits the
B6 posit as exactly the tensor-product identification. -/

/-- **The local operator algebra commutes (derived).** Alice's `U ⊗ I` and Bob's `I ⊗ Q` commute on the
bipartite tensor sector: `(U ⊗ I)(I ⊗ Q) = (I ⊗ Q)(U ⊗ I)`, both equal to `U ⊗ Q`. This is the algebraic
root of no-signalling, and it is a theorem of the Kronecker algebra, not a postulate. -/

/-- **Operator-level no-signalling on the tensor sector (re-exposed).** Bob's expectation of `I ⊗ Q` is
unchanged by Alice's local unitary `U ⊗ I`: Alice cannot signal to Bob. This is the operator-form
companion of the singlet marginal `HasNoSignalling` (T15), on the genuine tensor sector. From
`NoCommunication.no_communication`. -/
