# SigmaLayer/TensorSolved: why composition is the tensor product (P3, via local tomography)

**Category:** 7-SigmaLayer (the projective-sector layer (Paper C)).

`SigmaLayer/TensorGeneration.lean` reduced B6 by showing the commuting local subalgebras GENERATE the joint
observable algebra. This module proves that the **standard tensor (Kronecker) model REALIZES the
composition principles**: it is a canonical linear (and — see `TensorReconstruction.lean` — algebra)
equivalence

  `M_{NA} ⊗[ℂ] M_{NB}  ≃  M_{NA·NB}`,   `U ⊗ₜ Q  ↦  aliceOp U · bobOp Q  =  U ⊗ₖ Q`

(`compositeTensorEquiv`, wiring `kroneckerLinearEquiv`), in which the two operational facts

* **locality** — the local algebras commute (`aliceOp_bobOp_commute`);
* **local tomography** — every joint observable is a combination of local products
  (`joint_mem_span_local`);

both hold. So the tensor product is a MODEL satisfying locality + local tomography with dimension
`NA · NB` (`composite_is_tensor_product`).

## Honest scope — SUFFICIENCY here, UNIQUENESS in `TensorReconstruction.lean`

This module proves SUFFICIENCY: the Kronecker composite satisfies the composition principles. It does NOT
by itself prove NECESSITY — that an ARBITRARY composite carrying commuting, generating local algebras must
BE the tensor product. That converse (the actual reconstruction, `local matrix algebras + locality +
generation ⟹ ⊗`, with the dimension corollary `dim = NA · NB` discharging B6) is the abstract theorem
`compositeAlgReconstruction` / `composite_dim_eq` in `SigmaLayer/TensorReconstruction.lean`. Read together they
give the full statement; this file alone is the sufficiency half.

The operational content is the standard GPT reconstruction (Hardy; Chiribella–D'Ariano–Perinotti): "why
`⊗`" is answered by **local tomography** — the joint observables are spanned by local products. Local
tomography singles out the quantum tensor product among general composites (real-QM and other GPTs are NOT
locally tomographic and do NOT get `⊗`); it is here a PROVED property of the quantum local-algebra
structure (`joint_mem_span_local`). What is NOT derived (and cannot be, on pain of falsehood for
non-tomographic GPTs) is that the world must be locally tomographic.

/-- **The standard tensor model realizes the composition principles (P3 sufficiency).** Bundles, for the
Kronecker composite:

1. the map `M_{NA} ⊗ M_{NB} → M_{NA·NB}`, `U ⊗ₜ Q ↦ aliceOp U · bobOp Q`, is a BIJECTION (a linear
   isomorphism) — the tensor model carries exactly the local products, no more and no less;
2. its action is exactly the joint local product;
3. locality: the local algebras commute.

Together with local tomography (`joint_mem_span_local`) this shows the tensor product is a MODEL of
locality + generation with dimension `NA · NB`. It is the SUFFICIENCY half of "why `⊗`". The NECESSITY /
uniqueness half — that any composite with commuting, generating local algebras must BE this tensor product
— is `CSD.SigmaLayer.compositeAlgReconstruction` in `SigmaLayer/TensorReconstruction.lean`; only the two together force
composition to be `⊗`. -/
