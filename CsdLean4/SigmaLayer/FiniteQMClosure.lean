# FND/FiniteQMClosure: the tiered finite-dimensional QM closure (#6)

**Category:** 7-SigmaLayer (the Choice A ontology layer).

The capstone bundle. Every earlier module proves ONE reconstructed fact on the single many-to-one ontic
model `productDynamics H hH p₀` (isolated Hamiltonian flow `exp(-itH)` on `Σ = ℂℙ^M × T²`, Liouville
measure `μL = μFS ⊗ vol`, projection `π = Prod.fst`). This module collects the ones that are GENUINELY
PROVED on that model into a single record `FiniteQMClosure`, discharged by `unifiedFiniteQMClosure`, and —
crucially — states honestly, tier by tier, what is a theorem here, what is a Choice-A posit, what is a
textbook-QM adapter, and what is still open. No field is `sorry`; the structure carries only real theorems,
and the non-theorem tiers live in this docstring, not in fabricated fields.

## Tier 1 — PROVED on the unified model (the fields of `FiniteQMClosure`)

All eleven on the ONE model `productDynamics H hH p₀`:

* `isolated_flow_measure_preserving` — the isolated flow preserves `μL` (`ConstraintDynamics.flow_preserves`);
* `schrodinger_projection` — `π ∘ Φ_t = exp(-itH) • ·` (`productDynamicsBridge.projectable`);
* `fubini_study_bridge` — `π_* μL = μFS`, i.e. B1 (`productSector_hasFubiniStudyPushforward`);
* `measurement_preserving` — the de-isolation interaction preserves `μL`
  (`measurementFlow_measurePreserving`);
* `readout_ae_total` — the contextual pointer readout is a.e. defined (T6, `unifiedDeisolationModel_ae_total`);
* `records_established` — the readout records the established outcome, B5 (`unifiedDeisolationModel_records`);
* `records_time_physical` — the time-indexed record probability is conserved and flow-covariant, #5
  (`unified_records_persistence`);
* `born_frequency` — i.i.d. trials of `μL` have outcome-region frequency → `‖⟨eᵢ,ψ⟩‖²`, #2, for EVERY
  unit `ψ` (no genericity hypothesis — the `hpos` full-support requirement is retired via the `_uncond`
  engine, `unified_born_frequency` / `born_frequency_convergence_N_uncond`; vanishing amplitudes give
  FS-null regions whose frequencies converge to `0` = their Born weight);
* `conditioning_is_luders` — record conditioning = Lüders update as predictions, #3/#4
  (`conditioning_luders_effect_equivalence`);
* `mixed_born` — mixed states on the model (#8 C, weight level): for every density operator `ρ`, the
  classical mixture over `ρ`'s spectral ensemble of ontic Born-region measures reproduces `Tr(ρ Eᵢ)`
  (`mixed_ontic_born_weight`) — so the model carries mixed-state Born content, not only the pure `ψ`;
* `mixed_born_frequency` — the same mixed content as an a.s. FREQUENCY (#8 C, LLN): i.i.d. two-stage trials
  (spectral component `~ λ`, then microstate `~ μL`) have outcome-`i` frequency → `Tr(ρ Eᵢ)`
  (`unified_mixed_born_frequency`) — mixed-state Born as certified frequencies, not only weights.

## Tier 2 — ASSUMED under Choice A

The interpretive commitment that makes the above a reconstruction of QM rather than a study of a measure
space: taking the Fubini-Study/Liouville measure on `ℂℙ^M × T²` to BE the ontic probability law (Choice A;
see `specs/future-work.md`). This is a stance, not a Lean proposition, and is deliberately NOT a field. The
structural sub-posits that a bare Choice-A reconstruction would ALSO assume are, on this concrete model,
already DISCHARGED (hence they appear as tier-1 `fubini_study_bridge` etc., not here) — with one honest
exception recorded separately:

* **B6 (composite tensor structure)** — that a joint system's algebra is `M_m ⊗ M_n`. Posited per instance
  in `CompositeSector`, OR derived: `CSD.SigmaLayer.CompositeSector.ofReconstruction`
  (`FND/TensorReconstruction.lean`, `composite_dim_eq`) builds a `CompositeSector` whose `tensor_dimension`
  is PROVED from the composite algebra being simple — so B6 is "assumed OR dischargeable", not a gap. This
  is single-system closure; B6 belongs to the composite track and is intentionally outside `FiniteQMClosure`.

## Tier 3 — QM ADAPTERS (restatements into textbook QM, elsewhere)

`FND/Adapters.lean`, `FND/CompositeAdapters.lean`: the maps taking these ontic facts to their standard
Hilbert-space QM statements (density operators, Lüders channel, Born rule). They translate; they do not add
reconstruction content.

## Tier 4 — OPEN

* mixed-state / ensemble representation (#8): fully closed — the statistical side (#8 A+B,
  `FND/MixedEnsemble.lean`), the ontic-side WEIGHT-level representation (`mixed_born` /
  `mixed_ontic_born_weight`), AND the a.s. FREQUENCY LLN (`mixed_born_frequency` /
  `unified_mixed_born_frequency`, `FND/MixedFrequency.lean`: the two-stage mixture process redrawing the
  spectral component each shot). Mixed-state Born now holds as both weights and certified frequencies;
* the ECDLP circuit track's capstone `denote = divstepRev` + termination (`ECDLP/SafegcdDivstepCircuit.lean`)
  — independent of this QM closure, tracked separately.
