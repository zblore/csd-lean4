# LF6 — the entangled de-isolation tier (D1 frontier) — plan

**Status: A.1 + A.2 + A.3 DONE 2026-06-28 (entangled-tier A-stage complete); B.1 (decoherence) + B.2 (purity-drop witness) DONE 2026-06-28; C.1 (general-N tier: GHZ forced-contextuality crux) + C.2 (GHZ de-isolation flow, minimal computational-basis carve) + C.3 (GHZ Mermin-context carve: genuine dynamical contextuality) DONE 2026-06-30; C.4 (3-party GHZ local product flow) DONE 2026-07-02.** LF6 is the first concrete attack on the entangled / non-local
stratum of D1 (measurement dynamics), the deepest open debt. LF5 closed the single-system projective
measurement-dynamics tier (`Φ_vN ≠ id` de-isolation flow on the dilated projective space). LF6
extends de-isolation to the entangled case, where Bell forces non-locality. Target: a deterministic,
FS-measure-preserving de-isolation account that reproduces the LF3 singlet kernel `P_st`, with the
non-locality located honestly and no-signalling proven.

## The conceptual frame (settled in design, 2026-06-28)

- **The non-factorisation is in the Σ-volume engine, derived, not posited.** The moment-map /
  `BornRegion` engine reads the global entangled vector and returns joint weights `P_st(i,j)` that do
  not factor (`engine_joint_nonfactorises`), while its marginals do factor (`engine_marginal_factorises`,
  = no-signalling). The same engine that derives Born (the DH cluster) produces the entangled
  correlations; Born and non-locality are two outputs of one engine.
- **Contextuality is forced by Bell, not chosen.** A product (setting-local, non-contextual)
  outcome-partition of Σ is a deterministic LHV model; by `lhvCHSH_abs_le_two` it cannot reproduce the
  singlet's `2√2`. So any partition realising `P_st` must be jointly contextual. This is `LF6-A.1`'s
  `no_product_partition_realises_singlet`.
- **Mechanism: factorisation = measurement.** A product outcome-partition asserts setting-local
  definite values, which is a completed de-isolation. So factorisation cannot pre-exist the carve.
- **Nudge ≠ carve.** Pre-measurement unitary `Φ_U` volume reshaping (axis rotation, gates, the A1
  Ramsey phase flow) is available and reversible and produces no outcomes; the de-isolation carve is
  what produces pointer-definite outcomes. The context is set by a pre-measurement nudge; the carve
  follows it.
- **Residue = A5.** The entangled sector / the singlet's `Ω₀` is posited, not derived. LF6 threads
  dynamics through the entangled instance; it does not derive the entangled sector. A5 reduces to the
  deeper D1 strata.

## Stages

### LF6-A.1 — the forced-contextuality crux (DONE 2026-06-28)
`CsdLean4/LF6/ForcedContextuality.lean` (namespace `CSD.LF6`), auditor-SOUND, foundational-triple-only.
- `no_product_partition_realises_singlet` — no setting-local ±1 product partition of a shared
  probability space reproduces the singlet correlations (routes `ReproducesSinglet` → singlet CHSH
  `2√2` via `Bell.chsh_singlet_at_optimal_angles`, vs `E91.lhvCHSH_abs_le_two` ≤ 2). Both hypotheses
  proved load-bearing (auditor: `ReproducesSinglet` is satisfiable standalone by a non-±1 model, so
  the contradiction is genuinely the ±1/locality structure, not a trivial impossibility).
- `productPartition_nonvacuous` — product partitions exist (all-+1 reproduces a constant correlation),
  so the no-go is non-vacuous.
- `engine_joint_nonfactorises` — `P_st(i,j) ≠ P_A(i)·P_B(j)` (aligned axes: `P_st = 0 ≠ 1/4`).
- `engine_marginal_factorises` — marginals `= 1/2` both ways + no-signalling A/B (LF3 reuse).
Reuses `E91.lhvCHSH_abs_le_two`, `Bell.chsh_singlet_at_optimal_angles`, `LF3.P_st`/marginals; no Bell
re-proof, no kernel reinvention. 4 AxiomAudit pins.

### LF6-A.2 — the full singlet de-isolation flow (DONE 2026-06-28)
`CsdLean4/LF6/SingletDeisolationFlow.lean` (namespace `CSD.LF6`), foundational-triple-only, 5
AxiomAudit pins. The dynamical realisation on `Σ' = ℂℙ¹⁵ = ℙ(EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin 16))`
(`16 = 4·4`), built on the clean construction path (LF5 @ N=4 + LF3 + A.1), NOT a from-scratch
ℂℙ¹⁵ build:
- `singletDeisolationFlow := measurementFlow 4 finProdFinEquiv` with `singletDeisolation_measurePreserving`
  / `singletDeisolation_ne_id` (inherited from LF5-B); the flow is LOCAL (the LF5 de-isolation at N=4).
- `nudgedSinglet a b` — the prepared state `φ = (U_A^x⊗U_B^y)† ψ⁻`, the singlet in the rotated
  axis-context basis, in coordinates `φ_{stIdx(s,t)} = ⟨ψ⁻, singletJointEig s t a b⟩`; `nudgedSinglet_norm`
  (unit, `∑ P_st = 1`), `nudgedSinglet_born` (`‖⟨e_{stIdx(s,t)}, φ⟩‖² = P_st`, the unitary-invariance +
  LF3 `singletJointEig_born` step).
- `singletDeisolation_pointer_volume` (the headline) — joint `BornRegion` pointer-block `(s,t)` FS
  volume `= P_st a b s t`, COMPOSING `LF5.vnDilation_pointer_volume` @ N=4 with `nudgedSinglet_born`
  (which behind `singletJointEig_born` is `MeasurementJointEig.born_eq_P_st`). Born = volume IMPORTED
  from the DH/FS-volume engine, not re-derived.
- `singletDeisolation_frequency` — a.s. pointer-block frequency → `P_st` (`LF5.vnDilation_pointer_frequency`
  @ N=4 on `BornRegionUncond`).
- `singletDeisolation_blockVolume_correlation` — the carve's block-volume correlation is the singlet's
  `−a·b`; `singletDeisolation_carve_contextual` — ROUTES THROUGH A.1 `no_product_partition_realises_singlet`:
  no setting-local ±1 product partition reproduces it, so the carve is contextual (safety anchor).
- `singletDeisolation_flow_capstone` — 6-conjunct (≠ id ∧ FS-preserving ∧ pointer volume = P_st ∧
  block correlation = −a·b ∧ a.s. freq → P_st ∧ carve contextual via A.1).
The carve is the joint moment subdivision, never a setting-local `{ptr_A=i}∩{ptr_B=j}` product region.
Generic context (`hgen : P_st > 0`, every Bell setting). Flow factorisation `Φ = Φ_A ⊗ Φ_B` DEFERRED to
LF6-A.3 (the heavy tensor reindex; A.1 already shows local-flow ⊕ contextual-carve is consistent, so
A.2 is not blocked on it). Residue A5 (entangled sector posited).

**Auditor faithfulness note (A.2, recorded 2026-06-28, honest not a defect).** The capstone's
contextuality conjunct (`singletDeisolation_carve_contextual`) carries A.1's content (no setting-local
±1 product partition achieves the `−a·b` correlation); the A.2-specific increment is the separate
conjunct that the exhibited carve *achieves* `−a·b` (`singletDeisolation_blockVolume_correlation`). The
bridge "the exhibited carve is therefore not a product partition" is a juxtaposition of the two
conjuncts, not one composed theorem — because the carve (a `BornRegion` subdivision of `ℂℙ¹⁵` under FS
measure) and product partitions (LHV models on an abstract `Λ`) live in genuinely disjoint types. That
disjointness IS the contextuality (a contextual carve cannot be written as `IsProductPartition RA RB`),
so the informality is the honest content, not a gap. **CLOSED 2026-06-28** by
`singletDeisolation_carve_not_product` (correlation-match variant, auditor-SOUND): the corollary feeds the
carve's OWN achieved block-volume correlation (`carveBlockCorrelation`, the `s·t`-weighted sum of the
carve's `bornRegion` FS volumes — forced to `−dotR` via `singletDeisolation_blockVolume_correlation`) into
A.1's `no_product_partition_realises_singlet`, so "no product partition matches the exhibited carve" is now
one theorem, not a juxtaposition. Auditor: genuine (not A.1 restated), non-vacuous (refuted by CHSH across
the four settings, not by a contradictory `hmatch`). Recommended further strengthening (deferred): the
distribution-match form (`μ{RA=s ∧ RB=t} = P_st`) via a ±1-integral-to-cell-sum bridge lemma.

**OPEN DESIGN QUESTION for A.2 — RESOLVED 2026-06-28 (user: "measurement is contextual, continue").**
Does the de-isolation flow factor as `Φ = Φ_A ⊗ Φ_B`? Resolution: the FLOW is local (LF5 de-isolation
at N=4); the CARVE (joint `BornRegion` moment-subdivision) is contextual. A.2 built the local flow +
contextual carve; the explicit flow-factorisation `Φ = Φ_A ⊗ Φ_B` (the tensor reindexing) is DEFERRED
to LF6-A.3. Original framing retained below.
- Design position (carve-out reading): the FLOW can be local (`Φ_A ⊗ Φ_B`, each wing's de-isolation a
  local process), with ALL the non-locality in the jointly-contextual outcome PARTITION (the carve),
  per A.1. No non-local interaction is needed; the correlations come from the engine reading the
  entangled state.
- Tension: the A.1 expert suggested A.2 should *exhibit that the flow does NOT factor* as the
  dynamical counterpart of the no-go. The auditor's safety check: confirm the A.2 partition realising
  `P_st` is genuinely contextual (entangled `Σ'`) and that the `vnDilation_pointer_volume ∘ born_eq_P_st`
  composition does NOT assume the product structure A.1 forbids — that is where a vacuity could re-enter.
- Resolution to settle first: a local flow `Φ_A ⊗ Φ_B` acting on the entangled preparation, followed by
  a jointly-contextual carve, is consistent with A.1 (the no-go is about the carve/partition, not the
  flow). The thing to PROVE in A.2 is that the carve realising `P_st` is the contextual one (its A-marginal
  region depends on the far setting while its volume does not), NOT a product partition. Build that
  contextuality witness before/with the pointer-volume composition, so A.2 cannot silently assume the
  forbidden factorisation. This is the genuinely new physics content of A.2.

### LF6-A.3 — the local product de-isolation flow (DONE 2026-06-28)
`CsdLean4/LF6/LocalDeisolationFlow.lean` (namespace `CSD.LF6`), auditor-SOUND, foundational-triple-only,
4 AxiomAudit pins. Exhibits a genuinely LOCAL product de-isolation `V_loc = V_A ⊗ V_B` (each wing an
N=2 LF5 `vnDilationV`) realising the SAME joint singlet measurement, so the de-isolation needs NO
non-local interaction; the non-locality is entirely in the contextual carve (A.2) and the entangled
preparation (A5).
- `localDeisolation_factorises` — `V_loc` is a genuine Kronecker product of the two wing de-isolations
  (verified `rfl`; the reindex equivs are genuine bijections).
- `localDeisolation_pullback` — `(V_loc)ᴴ Π_{(i,j)} V_loc = |e_{(i,j)}⟩⟨e_{(i,j)}|`, GENUINELY composing
  the two per-wing LF5 `vnDilationV_pullback` via `conjTranspose_kronecker`/`mul_kronecker_mul`/
  `single_kronecker_single` (no `decide`/brute-force).
- `localNaimark : NaimarkDilation (basisPOVM 4)` (+ `localDeisolation_isom`) — the product dilation is a
  valid Naimark dilation, so the LF4 POVM-volume engine applies.
- `localDeisolation_pointer_volume` — the local product flow's pointer-block `(i,j)` FS volume `= P_st`,
  routing `povm_born_eq_dilated_volume_uncond` + `nudgedSinglet_born` (LF3). Same `hgen` (generic Bell
  setting) as A.2.
- `localDeisolationFlow_measurePreserving` / `_ne_id` — the projectivized product flow `U_A⊗U_B` is
  FS-measure-preserving and `≠ id`.
- `localDeisolation_capstone` — 5-conjunct (factorises ∧ ≠ id ∧ measure-preserving ∧ pointer volume =
  P_st ∧ valid Naimark).
HONEST framing honored: A.3 does NOT claim the A.2 `ℤ/4`-adder flow factors (it does not — `ℤ/4 ≠
ℤ/2×ℤ/2`); it builds a SEPARATE manifestly-local product flow. Born = FS volume imported (LF5/DH/
POVM-Naimark), not re-derived.
**Flow ↔ dilation tie CLOSED 2026-06-28** (auditor Minor resolved): `localDeisolationFlow_realises_localNaimark`
— `Φ_loc ⟦ψ ⊗ (a₀⊗a₀)⟧ = ⟦V_loc ψ⟧` for every `ψ ≠ 0` — folded into the capstone as a 6th conjunct, so
"the LOCAL flow realises the singlet measurement" is now fully a theorem. Proved from the file's own
kronecker/reindex scaffolding (`localDeisolationV_eq : V_loc = localFlowReindexed * localEmbedGround` via
`mul_kronecker_mul` + the `vnDilationV = vnUnitary * embedGround` defeq) + the projective `mk` step
mirroring LF5; the `ψ ≠ 0` side conditions are load-bearing (isometry/norm). Honest: it does NOT lift
LF5's `measurementFlow_realises_dilation` at N=4 (that `ℤ/4` object does not factor); it uses the genuine
product `U_A ⊗ U_B`. Auditor-SOUND. 5 AxiomAudit pins (capstone now 6-conjunct + the new lemma).

### LF6-B.1 — decoherence as coarse-graining over a conservative flow (DONE 2026-06-28)
`CsdLean4/LF6/Decoherence.lean` (namespace `CSD.LF6`), auditor-SOUND, foundational-triple-only, 6 pins.
The first open-system / partial-trace (D1b) result: the genuinely new physics beyond the global-beable
account. `vnDilationV` is the Stinespring isometry `V|ψ⟩ = ∑_j ψ_j |j⟩_S ⊗ |j⟩_ptr`; tracing the
unmonitored pointer decoheres the system to the Born mixture.
- `decohereReduced ψ := partialTraceRight (V · |ψ⟩⟨ψ| · Vᴴ)` (the system reduced state after de-isolation
  + pointer trace) — genuinely the partial trace, NOT defined diagonal.
- `decoherence_dephases` — `decohereReduced ψ = ∑_j ‖⟨e_j,ψ⟩‖² • |e_j⟩⟨e_j|`, the Born diagonal mixture.
  Genuinely computes the partial trace (`vnDilationV_conj_outerProduct` via `mul_vecMulVec`/`vecMulVec_mul`
  + `decohereReduced_apply` killing off-diagonal on the pointer δ). Auditor non-vacuity probe: a real
  superposition `(|0⟩+|1⟩)` has input coherence `1 ≠ 0`, output coherence `0` — decoherence happened.
- `decoherence_offdiagonal_vanish` (coherences provably zero), `decoherence_diagonal_born` (diagonal =
  Born weight), `decoherence_diagonal_eq_pointer_volume` (the decohered weights ARE the LF6/LF5 FS
  typicality volumes, via `vnDilation_pointer_volume` — imported, Gleason-free, not re-derived).
- `deisolation_conservative := vnDilationV_isom` (`VᴴV = 1`): conservative on the joint, dissipative
  only on the marginal — irreversibility is coarse-graining over a conservative isometric flow, NO
  fundamental stochasticity.
- `decoherence_capstone` (4-conjunct).
HONEST scope: reduced-density-operator decoherence (standard QM-validity object); the CSD increment is
the conservative-flow-coarse-graining reading. Subsumes metrology A4 (same open-system machinery).

### LF6-B.2 — the purity-drop / irreversibility witness (DONE 2026-06-28)
`CsdLean4/LF6/Decoherence.lean` (extended), auditor-SOUND, foundational-triple-only, 5 pins. Turns the
B.1 "irreversibility is emergent" narrative into a theorem.
- `decohereReduced_trace : (decohereReduced ψ).trace = ‖ψ‖²` (= 1 for unit ψ) — the reduced state is a
  genuine density operator (via `partialTraceRight_trace` + `trace_mul_comm` + `deisolation_conservative`).
- `decohereReduced_eq_diagonal` — the reduced state IS `diagonal (j ↦ ψ_j · star ψ_j)` (the Born weights).
- `decohere_purity_eq : Tr((decohereReduced ψ)²) = ∑_j ‖⟨e_j,ψ⟩‖⁴` (= ∑ p_j², via `diagonal_mul_diagonal`
  + `trace_diagonal`). Probe: equal superposition gives purity 1/2.
- `decohere_purity_le_one` (`∑ p_j² ≤ ∑ p_j = 1`, Parseval) and **`decohere_purity_lt_one_of_superposition`**
  (THE witness): `Tr(ρ_red²) < 1` strictly when ψ has ≥2 nonzero measurement-basis weights. The pure input
  (purity 1) decoheres to a MIXED state. Auditor confirmed the superposition hypotheses are LOAD-BEARING:
  at a single eigenstate purity stays exactly 1 (the witness correctly does not fire). The quantitative
  irreversibility / coherence-loss witness, `1 − Tr(ρ_red²) > 0`.
- `decoherence_irreversibility_capstone` (trace=1 ∧ purity=∑p_j² ∧ ≤1 ∧ <1).
HONEST: this is the LINEAR-entropy / purity witness; the von Neumann entropy increase is B.3 below.

### LF6-B.3 — the von Neumann entropy-increase witness (DONE 2026-07-01)
`CsdLean4/LF6/Decoherence.lean` (extended) + `Mathlib/QuantumInfo/Entropy.lean` (Cat-1), auditor-SOUND,
foundational-triple-only. Closes B.1/B.2's deferred B.3: the genuine von Neumann (Shannon-of-the-Born-vector)
entropy jump `0 → S > 0` under decoherence, past the linear-entropy/purity witness.
- Cat-1 (Entropy.lean, `namespace QuantumInfo` / top-level `Real`): `Real.negMulLog_pos` (`0<x<1 ⇒
  negMulLog x > 0`, the strict-interior companion to `negMulLog_nonneg`); `vonNeumannEntropy_diagonal`
  (`S(diagonal (fun i => (d i : ℂ))) = ∑ i, negMulLog (d i)`, the charpoly-of-diagonal route
  `charpoly_diagonal` + `spectral_sum_eq_of_charpoly_prod`, generalising `vonNeumannEntropy_const_smul_one`).
- `decohere_vonNeumann_entropy_eq : S(decohereReduced ψ) = ∑_j negMulLog(‖⟨e_j,ψ⟩‖²)` — the Shannon
  entropy of the Born vector, GENUINELY DERIVED (transport `decohereReduced_eq_diagonal` (B.2) into
  `vonNeumannEntropy_diagonal`), not asserted.
- `decohere_vonNeumann_entropy_nonneg`; **`decohere_vonNeumann_entropy_pos_of_superposition`** (THE
  witness): `0 < S` when ψ has ≥2 nonzero Born weights, via `negMulLog_pos` on a `p_j ∈ (0,1)`.
  Superposition hyp LOAD-BEARING (auditor: single eigenstate ⇒ S = negMulLog(1)+∑negMulLog(0) = 0, does
  not fire — mirrors B.2).
- `decoherence_vonNeumann_irreversibility_capstone` (S(pure)=0 ∧ S=∑negMulLog(p_j) ∧ ≥0 ∧ >0).
HONEST: the vN-entropy irreversibility witness (the pure→mixed entropy jump). Tier-2 unchanged
(reduced-density-operator decoherence; the CSD increment is the conservative-flow coarse-graining
`deisolation_conservative`, VᴴV=1; Born imported). STILL DEFERRED: the continuous-time Lindblad / T1-T2
semigroup; the environment-growth → PRACTICAL irreversibility (no-recoherence) account; the
system-marginal FS-volume-DRIFT geometry. Residue A5.

### LF6-C.1 — the general-N tier: GHZ forced-contextuality crux (DONE 2026-06-30)
`CsdLean4/LF6/GHZContextuality.lean` (namespace `CSD.LF6`), auditor-SOUND, foundational-triple-only, 6
AxiomAudit pins. Opens the general-N entangled tier by extending A.1 from the 2-party singlet to the
3-party GHZ state, with a qualitatively STRONGER forcing: DETERMINISTIC / all-or-nothing (the Mermin
GHZ paradox, no LHV at all) vs A.1's statistical CHSH bound (`2 < 2√2`).
- `no_product_partition_realises_ghz` (headline) — no setting-local ±1 product partition on a shared
  `(Λ,μ)` reproducing the four GHZ perfect-correlation expectations (⟨XXX⟩=+1, ⟨XYY⟩=⟨YXY⟩=⟨YYX⟩=−1)
  exists. ROUTES THROUGH the existing `Empirical.GHZ.no_lhv_assignment_for_ghz` (no GHZ re-proof): the
  private `pm_ae_eq` upgrades each expectation=±1 of a two-valued RV to pointwise=±1 a.e., the four
  full-measure sets intersect (probability measure ⟹ `NeBot (ae μ)`) to ONE microstate carrying a
  deterministic local ±1 assignment, which the no-go forbids — `False` at a single point, no inequality.
- Both hypotheses load-bearing (auditor probe-confirmed): **±1** via `pm_ae_eq` (a non-two-valued RV with
  mean 1 need NOT be a.e. 1 — so the EXPECTATION formulation, not pointwise, keeps ±1 essential; the
  pointwise form would make ±1 inert via the perfect-square argument); **locality** via
  `ghz_each_correlation_locally_realisable` (each of the four correlations is individually realisable by
  a local ±1 assignment — only one shared non-contextual assignment hitting all four fails).
- `productPartition_ghz_nonvacuous` (product partitions exist), `ghz_engine_joint_nonfactorises`
  (⟨XXX⟩=1 ≠ 0·0·0), `ghz_engine_marginal_factorises` (all six single-wing marginals = 0, no-signalling,
  via `ghz_expectation_formula`), `ghz_forced_contextuality_capstone`.
Honest scope: the forced-contextuality CRUX (A.1 analogue), NOT the GHZ de-isolation FLOW (that is
C.2 below). Residue A5 (GHZ sector posited). Born imported (LF4/LF5), not re-derived.

### LF6-C.2 — the GHZ de-isolation flow, minimal computational-basis carve (DONE 2026-06-30)
`CsdLean4/LF6/GHZDeisolationFlow.lean` (namespace `CSD.LF6`), auditor-SOUND, foundational-triple-only, 6
AxiomAudit pins. The dynamical realisation (`Φ ≠ id`) of the GHZ measurement at `N=8`, mirroring A.2:
- `ghzDeisolationFlow := measurementFlow 8 finProdFinEquiv` on `ℙ ℂ (EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin 64))`
  (`64 = 8·8`); `ghzDeisolation_ne_id` (`1<8`), `ghzDeisolation_measurePreserving` (inherited LF5-B).
- `ghzWeight` + `ghz_normSq_eq_weight` (`‖ghzState w‖² = ghzWeight w`, computed from the 8 basis evals:
  `1/2` on `(0,0,0)/(1,1,1)`, `0` else); `nudgedGHZ`, `nudgedGHZ_born`.
- `ghzDeisolation_pointer_volume` (headline) — pointer-block FS volume `= ghzWeight w`, genuinely
  COMPOSED `vnDilation_pointer_volume @ N=8 ∘ nudgedGHZ_born` (Born = volume imported, not re-derived).
- `ghzDeisolation_frequency` (a.s. block freq → GHZ Born); `ghzDeisolation_contextuality_anchor`
  (the C.1 no-go re-exported); `ghzDeisolation_flow_capstone` (5-conjunct).
**HONEST scope (auditor-verified): the MINIMAL computational-basis carve.** The diagonal block weights
`(1/2,0,…,0,1/2)` do NOT reproduce the Mermin X/Y correlations, so the carve is NOT itself contextual;
`ghzDeisolation_contextuality_anchor` (renamed from `_carve_contextual` per audit, to stop the name
implying a contextuality property of a carve it never touches) is a bare RE-EXPORT of C.1's no-go — the
anchor for the DEFERRED Mermin carve, not a claim about the diagonal carve. C.2 correctly OMITS any
`blockVolume_correlation` analogue (unlike A.2, which has a genuine `−a·b` block correlation for the
singlet). Tier-2: the flow REALISES (does not derive) the GHZ measurement; A5 residue.

### LF6-C.3 — the GHZ Mermin-context carve: genuine dynamical contextuality (DONE 2026-06-30)
`CsdLean4/LF6/GHZMerminCarve.lean` (namespace `CSD.LF6`), auditor-SOUND, foundational-triple-only, 9
AxiomAudit pins. The genuine contextual increment C.2's diagonal carve deferred: the de-isolation carve
DYNAMICALLY reproduces the four GHZ Mermin correlations, and the carve ties to C.1's no-go by its OWN
achieved values (not the C.2 re-export). New infrastructure: the GHZ Pauli-context joint eigenstructure.
- `localEig`/`localAmp` + `localEig_eigenvector` (genuine single-qubit σx/σy eigenstates ±|±⟩, ±|±i⟩,
  proved eigen-equation, not a stub); `ghzMerminEig ctx o` (their coordinatewise tensor); `ghzMerminEig_born`
  (`‖⟨ghz, ghzMerminEig ctx o⟩‖² = (1/16)(1 + signProd o · pv)²`, computed from the 8 GHZ amplitudes +
  `pv = phaseProd ctx` = +1 for XXX, −1 for XYY/YXY/YYX).
- `ghzDeisolation_blockVolume_correlation` (HEADLINE, all four contexts): the sign-product-weighted
  pointer-block FS-volume sum `= pv` = the Mermin expectation. Genuinely COMPOSED `vnDilation_pointer_volume`
  @ N=8 ∘ `ghzMerminEig_born` + the algebra `sum_signProd_merminWeight` ((1+pv)²−(1−pv)²=4pv). This is what
  C.2's diagonal re-export lacked. **The carve value = the QM Hilbert Mermin expectation `re⟨ghz|σσσ|ghz⟩`
  for ALL FOUR contexts** (`merminCarveCorrelation_eq_{xxx,xyy,yxy,yyx}`, via `ghz_expectation_*` — the
  three −1 mirrors added per audit F1, so the numeric/structural tie is complete, not XXX-only).
- `ghzDeisolation_carve_not_product` (the dynamical carve-tie, four-context tie CLOSED, not staged): feeds
  the carve's OWN four achieved correlations into C.1 `no_product_partition_realises_ghz` (Mermin +1=−1);
  auditor-verified non-vacuous and one-theorem (the A.2 `singletDeisolation_carve_not_product` analogue).
  Upgrades C.2's bare re-export `ghzDeisolation_contextuality_anchor` to a genuine carve-tied theorem.
- `ghzMermin_carve_capstone` (5 conjuncts).
Honest: the deferred tripartite eigen-equation (`sigmaDotTriple` = tensor of the three proven local
eigen-eqs) is auditor-verified NOT load-bearing (the Born identity routes through amplitudes, not through
`localEig_eigenvector`) — honest deferral, not a hidden gap. Tier-2: Born = FS volume imported (LF5/DH),
flow REALISES not derives; A5 residue. Reuses the Empirical GHZ Mermin structure + C.1/C.2; no GHZ re-proof.

### LF6-C.4 — the 3-party GHZ local product flow (DONE 2026-07-02)
`CsdLean4/LF6/GHZLocalFlow.lean` (namespace `CSD.LF6`), auditor-SOUND, foundational-triple-only, 7
AxiomAudit pins. The 3-party analogue of A.3: a manifestly-LOCAL product de-isolation
`V_loc = V₀ ⊗ V₁ ⊗ V₂` (three N=2 wings) realising the SAME GHZ measurement, so the de-isolation needs
NO non-local interaction; the GHZ non-locality lives entirely in the contextual carve (C.1/C.3) + the
entangled preparation (A5).
- `ghzLocalV` + `ghzLocal_factorises` (genuine triple Kronecker `V₀ ⊗ₖ (V₁ ⊗ₖ V₂)`, manifest locality).
- `ghzLocal_pullback` — `(V_loc)ᴴ Π_{(i,j,k)} V_loc = |e_{(i,j,k)}⟩⟨e_{(i,j,k)}|`, GENUINELY composing the
  three per-wing pullbacks: `conjTranspose_kronecker` + `mul_kronecker_mul` split off the outer wing
  (`wingDeisolation_pullback`) and REUSE A.3's proven 2-wing `localDeisolation_pullback` for wings 1,2,
  recombined by `single_kronecker_single` (no `decide`). The genuine increment = one more Kronecker layer.
- `ghzLocalNaimark : NaimarkDilation (basisPOVM 8)` (via `blockProj_ghzReindex`); `ghzLocal_pointer_volume`
  (pointer-block FS volume = `ghzWeight`, via `povm_born_eq_dilated_volume_uncond ∘ nudgedGHZ_born`);
  `ghzLocalFlow_measurePreserving` / `_ne_id`; `ghzLocalFlow_realises_localNaimark`
  (`Φ_loc [ψ ⊗ (a₀⊗a₀⊗a₀)] = [V_loc ψ]`, ψ≠0); `ghzLocal_capstone` (6-conjunct).
Honest (mirrors A.3): a SEPARATE manifestly-local product flow, NOT a claim that C.2's ℤ/8 `measurementFlow`
factors (ℤ/8 ≠ ℤ/2×ℤ/2×ℤ/2). Born imported (LF5/DH/POVM-Naimark), flow realises not derives; residue A5.

### LF6-D — the general d×d maximally-entangled de-isolation flow (DONE 2026-07-03)
`CsdLean4/LF6/MaxEntangledDeisolationFlow.lean` (namespace `CSD.LF6`), foundational-triple-only, 7
AxiomAudit pins. The first genuinely DIMENSION-GENERAL entangled instance (the tier previously had only
the 2×2 singlet A-tier and the 3-qubit GHZ C-tier). The bipartite maximally-entangled state
`Ψ_d = (1/√d) ∑ᵢ |i⟩|i⟩` on `EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin d × Fin d)`, every `d ≥ 2`.
- `maxEntangled d` + `medWeight` (Born = `1/d` on the diagonal, `0` off); `maxEntangled_normSq_eq_weight`,
  `sum_medWeight` (unit-norm), `maxEntangled_marginal_uniform` (the diagonal Born-weight marginal is
  uniform `1/d`; this does not by itself establish `ρ_A = I/d`, which needs off-diagonal vanishing).
- **De-isolation flow + Born-from-volume (the LOAD-BEARING content — general-N is now genuinely general).**
  REUSES the LF5 general-N engine at `N = d·d`: `maxEntangledDeisolation_pointer_volume` (pointer-block FS
  volume = `medWeight`, composing LF5 `vnDilation_pointer_volume` @ N=d·d with the reindex Born identity
  `nudgedMaxEntangled_born`), `maxEntangledDeisolation_frequency` (a.s. block freq → `medWeight`),
  `_ne_id` (Φ≠id, `1<d·d`), `_measurePreserving`. Born = FS-volume IMPORTED from the DH engine, not
  re-derived; the flow realises the measurement, does not derive the weights.
- **Forced non-factorisation** (`no_product_partition_realises_maxEntangled`, all `d ≥ 2`;
  2026-07-03 rewrite — DERIVED, maxEntangled-specific, no longer a verbatim singlet re-export): (a) the
  sector's diagonal Born-weight marginal is uniform `1/d` (`maxEntangled_sector_marginal_uniform`); (b)
  the `{0,1}²` Schmidt sector IS the Bell `Φ⁺` state up to `√2/√d`, coherences included
  (`maxEntangledSector_eq_phiPlus`, full state, `d`-dependent); (c) no product partition reproduces the
  sector's OWN `Φ⁺` correlation (`no_product_partition_realises_phiPlus`). `Φ⁺`'s two-qubit Pauli
  correlation `⟨Φ⁺|σ·a⊗σ·b|Φ⁺⟩ = a_x b_x − a_y b_y + a_z b_z` is COMPUTED from the Hilbert space
  (`phiPlus_pauli_correlation`, mirrors `LF3.expectation_formula`); the orthogonal `xz`-reflection
  `reflectXZ` of Bob's axis carries `E_{Φ⁺}` to the singlet's `−a·b` (`phiPlusCorrelation_reflectXZ`), so
  `Φ⁺` reaches the same `2√2 > 2` (LHV cap `|S| ≤ 2`, `lhvCHSH_abs_le_two`), reducing to
  `no_product_partition_realises_singlet` on the relabeled partition. So the CHSH violation is DERIVED for
  `Φ⁺` (not the singlet's imported by prose). Scope: forced by the CHSH-violating 2×2 `Φ⁺` sector; a full
  general-`d` CGLMP result is NOT claimed.
- `maxEntangledDeisolation_flow_capstone` (7-conjunct, adds sector = `Φ⁺` and the `Φ⁺` no-go). Residue
  A5 (entangled sector posited).

### CGLMP infrastructure (d-intrinsic route, step 1 DONE 2026-07-03)
`CsdLean4/Mathlib/Probability/CGLMP.lean` (Cat-1, `ProbabilityTheory.CGLMP`, CSD-free), auditor-SOUND,
foundational-triple. The qudit Bell infrastructure toward making LF6-D's non-factorisation genuinely
`d`-intrinsic (rather than routed through the 2×2 `Φ⁺` sector): the genuine standard CGLMP functional
`I_d` (8-term grouping, coefficients `1 − 2k/(d−1)`, mod-`d` outcome relations; tightness-certified so
the classical bound is exactly 2), the general-`d` deterministic reduction (`cglmpLHV_eq_integral` +
`cglmpLHV_le_of_det_le`, the LHV → finite-optimisation convexity bridge), and the LHV bound `I_d ≤ 2`
proved for `d = 2, 3, 4` via kernel `decide` on the division-cleared integer functional `scaledDetZ ≤
2(d−1)`. Named residual: the general-`d` numeric bound (the CGLMP counting argument). **Step 2 (pending):
the QM-side violation `I_3 > 2` on the maximally-entangled qutrit `Ψ_3` (≈ 2.873), contradicting
`cglmp_lhv_bound_three`, upgrading `no_product_partition_realises_maxEntangled` from the 2×2-sector
routing to genuinely `d=3`-intrinsic forcing.**

### LF6 remaining (not started)
Continuous-time Lindblad; the marginal volume-drift geometry; the rest of the general-N tier (n-party
GHZ_n [queued next]; the CGLMP d-intrinsic step 2 above); threading `Φ` through the concrete entangled
`SectorData` (D1c). A5 emergence (deriving the entangled sector from the dynamics) is the downstream
target that would retire the residue.

## Honest posture (carried into each file)
LF6 realises the singlet on a deterministic substrate and locates the non-locality precisely (in the
engine / contextual carve, derived; forced by Bell). It is a global-beable, jointly-contextual,
no-signalling account, the standard escape made measure-theoretic — NOT a Bell-local model and NOT a
Bell violation. The entangled sector (`Ω₀`, A5) is posited; LF6 supplies dynamics modulo A5, exactly as
Born is derived modulo A5.
