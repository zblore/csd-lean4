# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Where to start (plans & todos)

**[`specs/INDEX.md`](specs/INDEX.md) is the orientation map** for every plan / todo /
reference doc, with one-line status on each. Read it first when picking up work. The
**POVM tranche is closed** ([`specs/povm-plan.md`](specs/povm-plan.md), DONE 2026-06-03 —
the ontic Born derivation now covers general non-projective measurements via the canonical
Naimark dilation, Gleason-free). The **LF5 single-system projective measurement-dynamics
tier is closed** ([`specs/lf5-plan.md`](specs/lf5-plan.md), LF5-A..E DONE 2026-06-09..11;
layer headline `measurement_flow_born_frequency`): a deterministic, FS-measure-preserving
von Neumann de-isolation flow `Φ_vN ≠ id` realises the Naimark dilation dynamically and
its pointer-block volumes / a.s. frequencies are the Born weights, for every unit
preparation (the `hpos` genericity was retired by the unconditional engine,
`LF4/BornRegionUncond.lean`). LF5-F (2026-06-14) adds the per-microstate outcome
map: `bornRegion_pairwiseDisjoint` → `vnPointerOutcome` → `measurement_flow_outcome_frequency`
(`LF4/BornRegionDisjoint.lean` + `LF5/PointerOutcome.lean`), discharging the
outcome-function caveat owed since `aeece86`. **The open frontier remains D1's deeper strata**
([`specs/carve-out-plan.md`](specs/carve-out-plan.md) §6): the entangled / non-local
de-isolation tier, the A5 sector origin, and threading the flow through the concrete
`SectorData` instances (which still carry `Φ = id`). Axiom posture and the two-strata
(operational Gleason vs ontic volume) reading live in [`AXIOMS.md`](AXIOMS.md) §2.

**Doc-currency discipline (mandatory).** When a tranche lands, updating the docs is part of
"done", not a later chore. In the *same commit* as the Lean work, update: the
[`specs/INDEX.md`](specs/INDEX.md) status row, the relevant plan-file header
(`planned/not started` → `DONE <date>`), the matching `LF4-todo.md` §-entry, and any
README / EMPIRICAL.md / AXIOMS.md table the result touches — plus the AxiomAudit pins for
new headlines. Convert relative dates to absolute. The 2026-06-08 currency sweep found the
entire algorithm branch, the one-axiom posture, the Shor status, and §2 all stale because
prior closures were logged only to session memory; this rule exists to prevent recurrence.
Do not let "planned / not started" rows survive a completed tranche.

## Build Commands

```bash
# Build the library (CsdLean4 target — LF1/LF2/LF3/LF4/Empirical/Mathlib, no tests)
lake build

# Build the test target (AxiomAudit + Examples; required to fire #guard_msgs)
lake build CsdLeanTests

# Check a single file
lake env lean CsdLean4/LF1/MainTheorem.lean

# Update dependencies (after editing lakefile.toml)
lake update
```

The build configuration lives in `lakefile.toml` (not `lakefile.lean`); Mathlib
is pinned by `rev` there, bumped in lockstep with `lean-toolchain`.

The project uses **Lean 4.29.0-rc8** (see `lean-toolchain`) and depends on **Mathlib4**. There is no separate test runner — the Lean typechecker is the verification mechanism. A clean `lake build` plus a clean `lake build CsdLeanTests` with no errors and no `sorry`s constitutes a verified proof plus a green regression suite.

CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) builds both targets on push to `main`/`master` and on all PRs. The library target uses `leanprover/lean-action@v1`; the test target is built with a direct `lake build CsdLeanTests` step.

## Architecture

This project formalizes **Constraint-Surface Dynamics (CSD)** as a linear stack
of layers. **LF1** (deterministic repeated-trial frequency theorem), **LF2**
(sector-conditional measure bridge + Born-weight wrapper), **LF3** (singlet
kernel + the LF1↔LF2↔LF3 empirical chain), and **LF4 §14.2** (observable
correspondence + Robertson uncertainty on a concrete compact-Kähler instance)
are all merged and machine-verified, alongside an **Empirical** QM-validity
regression suite. The LF1 core claim: empirical frequencies of outcomes in
deterministic repeated-trial experiments converge almost surely to ontic volume
weights. Each higher layer instantiates / consumes the previous (LF2's
`SectorData.toOntic` produces an LF1 `OnticSetup`; LF4 instantiates `SectorData`
on `ℂℙ^{M-1} × T²`).

The detailed per-layer architecture for LF1, LF2, and LF3 follows; LF4 and
Empirical are summarised at the end. The README is the current authoritative
status overview; this file is the working-with-the-code guide.

### Key design choice: determinism

Probability enters only through **repeated-preparation sampling** — each trial draws a new initial microstate from a conditional measure on a preparation region Ω₀. The ontic evolution Φ is a deterministic measure-preserving flow. There is no intrinsic randomness at the ontic level.

### Module dependency chain (linear, each imports the previous)

```
Setup.lean          — OnticSetup: measurable space Σ, Liouville measure μL,
                      deterministic flow Φ, preparation region Ω₀
Preparation.lean    — prepMeasure: conditional measure μprep(A) = μL(A ∩ Ω₀) / μL(Ω₀)
Outcomes.lean       — OutcomeRegion: measurable subsets, preEvent pullbacks, weight
Trials.lean         — TrialModel: i.i.d. preparation sampling, repeated-trial space
Indicators.lean     — indicatorRV, empiricalFreq (Bernoulli 0/1 per trial)
Expectation.lean    — Bridge: E[indicatorRV O n] = O.weightReal
Convergence.lean    — Applies Mathlib's strong law of large numbers
MainTheorem.lean    — LF1_main_theorem_ae and corollaries
```

`CsdLean4.lean` (the root file) is the canonical top-level import — it lists every module explicitly. `CsdLean4/Basic.lean` is the conventional `Pkg.Basic` convenience re-export that transitively pulls in the chain via `MainTheorem`. Downstream layers and external consumers should `import CsdLean4.Basic`; edits inside the package should modify the explicit list in `CsdLean4.lean`.

Higher layers are sibling directories (`CsdLean4/LF2/`, `LF3/`, `LF4/`, `Empirical/`, `Mathlib/`), each instantiating or consuming the previous. New top-level modules must be added explicitly to `CsdLean4.lean` — that file is not glob-based.

All definitions live under the `CSD.LF1` namespace, with sub-namespaces `OnticSetup` and `OnticSetup.TrialModel`. New lemmas should follow this pattern.

### Main theorem signature

```lean
theorem LF1_main_theorem_ae
    (T : S.TrialModel Ω)
    (O : S.OutcomeRegion)
    (hindep :
      Pairwise
        (Function.onFun
          (fun f g : Ω → ℝ => IndepFun f g T.trialMeasure)
          (fun n => T.indicatorRV (S := S) O n))) :
    ∀ᵐ ω ∂ T.trialMeasure,
      Tendsto (T.empiricalFreq O · ω) atTop (nhds O.weightReal)
```

The only hypothesis the caller must supply is pairwise independence of trial indicators (`hindep`). Integrability and identical distribution are proved internally. The `Function.onFun` wrapping is the standard Mathlib spelling for `Pairwise` applied to a binary relation `IndepFun · · μ` lifted along the indexing `n ↦ T.indicatorRV O n`; no CSD-namespace abbreviation is introduced.

The theorem is deliberately stated for a **single** `O : OutcomeRegion` rather than a formalised partition family. The joint almost-sure statement for a finite measurable outcome partition `{Ω_i^Σ}` follows by applying the theorem once per element and intersecting the resulting full-measure sets. Do not refactor this into a partition type at the LF1 layer — the single-outcome form is intentional (see the docstring of `MainTheorem.lean`). A partition type may become necessary at LF2/LF4 for POVM completeness.

### Key infrastructure lemmas (used by future layers)

- `prepMeasure_apply` — explicit rewriting formula for the conditional measure (consumed by LF2/LF4)
- `weight_eq_prepEvent_div` — volume interpretation of weights
- `trialEvent_eq_comp_preimage` — makes deterministic structure explicit
- `indicatorRV_integrable`, `indicatorRV_identDistrib` — prerequisites for the strong law

### LF2: measure bridge and Born-weight wrapper

LF2 sits directly on top of LF1 and delivers:

- the sector-conditional **measure bridge** `π*μL = c • μFS` connecting ontic
  Liouville volume to an abstract projective reference measure;
- the **Born-weight wrapper** packaging finite-dimensional probability under
  an explicit operational consistency package (spec Definition 5.1);
- the **proved Born quadratic form** `wᵢ = ‖⟨ψ, φᵢ⟩‖²` for rank-1 outcomes on
  pure preparations;
- the **LF1 ↔ LF2 weight identity** linking `μprep(π⁻¹(O))` to
  `(π*μprep)(O)`, so `LF1_main_theorem_ae` consumers can reinterpret the
  limiting ontic weight as a projective weight.

```

**LF2 is the first layer with an `axiom` declaration.** LF1 is
axiom-and-sorry-free; LF2 has exactly **one** axiom:

- `busch_effect_gleason` — effect-additive probability on finite-dim
  operational packages admits a unique trace-form density operator.
  Spec-mandated (§7.4). Not in Mathlib. Confined to the operational stratum;
  the ontic Born derivation is Gleason-free.

A second axiom, `invariant_measure_uniqueness` (invariant-measure uniqueness on
the abstract projective target), was **removed 2026-06-04**: nothing downstream
used the abstract `measure_bridge` statement that carried it (the concrete
instances build the bridge axiom-free via `cp_measure_bridge` / `k_measure_bridge`),
and its concrete `ℂℙ^{N-1}` content is a proved axiom-free theorem
(`Matrix.UnitaryGroup.invariant_measure_uniqueness_cpn`). The abstract
`measure_bridge` lemma and the `MeasureBridgeData.ofSectorData` constructor were
deleted with it.

Note on the axiom posture vs CSD's physical postulates: this `busch_effect_gleason`
import is *library debt* (a standard theorem not yet in Mathlib), not a commitment
of the physical theory. CSD's actual postulates — the ontic substrate, the sector
posit, and typicality — are carried as hypotheses/structure fields, so they never
appear in `#print axioms`. See `AXIOMS.md §0`.

`rankOneDensity_unique_of_certainty` was carried as a third axiom in earlier
revisions (a density operator that assigns probability one to `|ψ⟩⟨ψ|` is
`|ψ⟩⟨ψ|` itself); it is now a proved theorem (discharged 2026-05-18). The
proof routes through `Matrix.PosSemidef.dotProduct_mulVec_zero_iff`: the
sandwich `(I−P) ρ (I−P)` is PSD with trace zero (by trace cyclicity and the
certainty hypothesis), hence zero; so `ρ · (I−P) = 0` and thus `ρ = P ρ P`.
The rank-1 sandwich identity `P · M · P = Tr(M · P) • P` then collapses ρ
to `1 • P = P`. Used to strengthen `pure_state_born_weights` so that the "OP
is certain at ψ" hypothesis suffices to conclude `|⟨ψ|φ⟩|²` — without it,
the pure-state endpoint requires the caller to already know `OP.p E =
traceForm (rankOneDensity ψ) E` for every effect, which is almost the
conclusion.

Everything else is proved. Notably, `born_quadratic` is a genuine Lean proof
(trace-of-outer-product identity + conjugate symmetry + `RCLike.mul_conj`),
not a narrative corollary.

**LF2 design choices:**

- `SectorData` is parametric in an abstract `(SigmaSpace, P, G)`. The projective
  target `P` is **not** specialised to Mathlib's `Projectivization`; no
  Fubini–Study measure is constructed. Concrete instantiation is deferred to
  LF4+.
- `SectorData` carries **group-action coherence fields**
  (`onticAction_one`, `onticAction_mul`, `epAction_one`, `epAction_mul`)
  expressing the left-action laws for `onticAction` and `epAction`. LF2's
  own theorems don't consume them, but LF4 will when it uses
  transitivity / orbits / Haar measure.
- The reference measure `μFS` is **not** a field of `SectorData`; it enters
  `measure_bridge` as an explicit argument, keeping `SectorData`
  `μFS`-agnostic.
- `Effect` and `DensityOperator` are concrete `Matrix (Fin N) (Fin N) ℂ`
  structures (not opaque stubs). This gives real Lean content to the Born
  quadratic form.
- `Effect.add` takes the `le_one` hypothesis (`1 - (E.M + F.M)).PosSemidef`)
  as an explicit argument — no `Option`-valued addition, no
  `Decidable (PosSemidef _)` required.
- `Effect.conjugateBy (U : Matrix.unitaryGroup (Fin N) ℂ)` returns `U† E U`
  as an `Effect`. This is the structural helper for spec Def 5.1 clause 3
  (unitary covariance), but the clause itself is **not** a field on
  `OperationalPackage` — both natural readings have issues (invariance
  over-constrains; covariance is type-heavy). Deferred to LF4; see
  `specs/LF4-todo.md` §1.
- `ComplexOrder` is opened scoped in `BornWrapper.lean` so that `ℂ` has the
  `PartialOrder` / `StarOrderedRing` instances required by `Matrix.PosSemidef`.

**Key infrastructure lemmas exported by LF2** (consumed by LF4+):

- `measure_bridge` — the central bridge theorem
- `lf1_weight_eq_projective_weight` — the LF1 ↔ LF2 hinge (measure identity)
- `LF1_main_theorem_projective` — the LF1 ↔ LF2 headline theorem: LF1
  frequency convergence, stated natively in projective form. This is the
  theorem-level consumption of LF1 by LF2 (not just structural)
- `outerProduct_posSemidef`, `one_sub_outerProduct_posSemidef` — projection
  lemmas useful wherever rank-1 effects appear downstream
- `born_quadratic` — the quadratic form in Lean; any LF4+ Born-weight
  consumer can cite it
- `pure_state_born_weights_of_certainty` — derives `|⟨ψ,φ⟩|²` from a
  purity hypothesis (`OP.p` is certain at `ψ`), routing through the
  Busch axiom + matrix uniqueness

### LF3: singlet kernel and the LF1↔LF2↔LF3 empirical chain

LF3 sits on top of LF2 and delivers:

- the **singlet kernel** `P_{st}(a, b) = (1 − st·a·b)/4` and its operational
  consequences (correlation `−a·b`, marginals `1/2`, no-signalling on each
  side, pointer-completeness);
- the **finite-leakage stability** of all four quantities, parameterised by
  per-side leakage parameters `εA`, `εB`;
- the **LF1↔LF2↔LF3 empirical chain capstones**, three per-sector +
  three joint-partition variants (Phase 8):
  `LF3_singlet_frequency_convergence` (pre-Born, landing on `(1 − st a·b)/4`),
  `LF3_singlet_frequency_convergence_born` (closed-form Born, `‖cAmp‖²`),
  `LF3_singlet_frequency_convergence_born_inner` (bra-ket Born), plus
  `..._joint`, `..._born_joint`, `..._born_inner_joint` (joint AE over
  the Sign × Sign partition).

```

**LF3 axiom inheritance (re-routed off Busch 2026-06-02).**
`LF3_main_theorem` and `LF3_finite_leakage_theorem` are fully axiom-clean
(only the Mathlib foundational triple). The six chain capstones (three
per-sector + three joint variants) are **now also foundational-triple-only**:
`weight_eq_P_st` routes the chain bridge through the Busch-free
`OP_p_at_jointEig_eq_P_st_direct` (the ontic-stratum, direct volume-ratio Born
step via `LF2.PurePreparation.born_rank_one_direct`) instead of the
Busch-mediated `OP_p_at_jointEig_eq_P_st`. So the LF3 empirical chain (and the
LF4 `ofKählerPreparation_singlet_frequency_convergence` capstone, and the
Empirical `bell_singlet_frequency_convergence` re-export) is Gleason-free.
`busch_effect_gleason` is retained as the **operational-stratum** statement,
still cited by `pure_state_born_weights_of_certainty`, `born_rank_one`,
`OP_p_at_jointEig_eq_P_st`, and `ontic_born_frequency`. (Earlier, post-Phase-7,
the chain was deliberately Busch-mediated per spec §5.4; the 2026-06-02 re-route
realises the two-strata posture of AXIOMS.md §2.4 — operational route kept,
ontic chain moved onto the volume derivation.)
The measure-bridge symmetry datum enters via the `MeasureBridgeData` argument,
which the concrete LF4 instances supply **axiom-free** (`cp_measure_bridge` /
`k_measure_bridge`); the abstract `measure_bridge` lemma and the
`invariant_measure_uniqueness` axiom it carried were removed 2026-06-04, so no
chain capstone carries that axiom. This is the spec §5.4 four-ingredient
combinatorial framing realised at the Lean level.

**LF3 design choices:**

- `Sign` is a two-element inductive `| plus | minus` (spec §9.4).
- The two-qubit factor `HAB` is `EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin 2 × Fin 2)`
  (matching the `Fin 2 × Fin 2` indexing on `pauliDot ⊗ pauliDot`).
- `MeasurementUnitary` carries the full and per-wing unitaries as
  `LinearIsometryEquiv` (Mathlib idiom); unitarity is encoded in the type.
- Self-adjointness on continuous linear maps is stated via the inner-product
  equation `∀ x y, inner ℂ (T x) y = inner ℂ x (T y)` to avoid `Star`
  typeclass synthesis on `H_SA →L[ℂ] H_SA`.
- `cAmp` is defined in **closed form** as `(Real.sqrt (P_st a b s t) : ℂ)`.
  This sidesteps the explicit construction of joint spin eigenstates;
  downstream theorems consume only `‖cAmp‖²`, so a future swap to
  `cAmp := inner ℂ jointSpinEig singlet` is transparent. The bra-ket
  equivalence is exposed via `cAmp_norm_sq_eq_inner_norm_sq` (under a
  rank-1 projector hypothesis) and via the
  `LF3_singlet_frequency_convergence_born_inner` capstone variant.
- The `LF1↔LF2↔LF3` chain capstones consume a `PureSingletPreparation D ctx N`
  bundle whose load-bearing hypotheses are the option (B) split:
  `MeasurementJointEig.born_eq_P_st : ‖⟨ψ, eig s t⟩‖² = P_st` (the Born
  identity for the joint spin eigenstate, LF4-todo §3 discharge target)
  and `PureSingletPreparation.bridge_op_p : μψ(preEvent) = ENNReal.ofReal (OP.p (rankOneEffect (eig s t)))`
  (the ontic-weight ↔ OP.p bridge, LF4-todo §2 + §7 discharge target).
  The bundle's `weight_eq_P_st` theorem composes the two via
  `LF3.OP_p_at_jointEig_eq_P_st` (Phase 6) which cites
  `LF2.PurePreparation.born_rank_one` (which cites Busch). **The
  preparation primitive is a posited fibre trial law `μψ`, not the ambient
  `μL`-conditional `prepMeasure`** (posited-fibre-measure migration,
  2026-05-25): under the continuous measure bridge `π∗μL = c·μFS` every
  state's fibre is `μL`-null, so a `μL`-conditional pure preparation is
  uninhabitable. The capstones take i.i.d. trials with common law `μψ` and
  route through `LF1.freq_tendsto_of_iid` (not `LF1_main_theorem_ae`). See
  `LF4-todo §8`.

**LF3 is sorry-free.** All capstone exports and supporting lemmas are
sorry-free. The chain capstones are **foundational-triple-only** (cite
`propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound`) after the 2026-06-02 re-route off
Busch; `LF3_main_theorem` and `LF3_finite_leakage_theorem` were already
axiom-clean.

**LF3 self-adjointness convention.** `BinaryPointerProjectors`,
`TensorFactorReadoutAlgebra`, `ProjectorAlgebra`, and `mHat_isSelfAdjoint`
state self-adjointness via the inner-product equation
`∀ x y, inner ℂ (T x) y = inner ℂ x (T y)` rather than Mathlib's
`IsSelfAdjoint T` predicate. This deviates from idiom but is forced: the
`Star (H →L[ℂ] H)` typeclass synthesis on a finite-dim complex inner-product
space fails even with `Mathlib.Analysis.InnerProductSpace.Adjoint` imported
(the adjoint construction needs full completeness boilerplate Mathlib
doesn't synthesise for our `[NormedAddCommGroup H] [InnerProductSpace ℂ H]
[FiniteDimensional ℂ H]` setup). The inner-product spelling is
mathematically equivalent and avoids the synthesis dead-end.

### LF4: concrete compact-Kähler instance and §14.2 observable correspondence

LF4 is the layer where the abstract `SectorData` framework acquires a concrete
inhabitant and projective objects acquire ontic content. It instantiates
`SectorData` on a genuinely compact-Kähler `Σ` and discharges the
observable-correspondence target (spec §14.2).

LF4 module chain (under `CsdLean4/LF4/`, namespace `CSD.LF4`):

```

**POVM tranche is closed (P.1–P.5, 2026-06-03).** The ontic Born = Kähler-volume
derivation now covers general (non-projective) POVMs: every POVM acquires a canonical
Naimark dilation onto a larger ontic `Σ' = ℂℙ^{N·|ι|−1}` (the ancilla is the
apparatus/environment), where the achieved general-`N` result reads the POVM Born weight
`⟨ψ,Eᵢψ⟩` as a sum of Fubini–Study volumes and empirical frequencies converge to it —
**carving-free, Gleason-free, unconditional**. `busch_effect_gleason` is now fully off the
ontic Born path (projective and POVM); it survives only as the operational-stratum
statement. Honest residue: A5 (the sector posit, enlarged by the ancilla on `Σ'`) and D1
(dynamics; `Φ = id`). The `POVM` type + Born-weight completeness live in `LF2/POVM.lean`.
See `specs/povm-plan.md`.

**§14.2 is closed.** The observable-correspondence chain (six commits,
`eeec1e8`→`c5eed61`) is fully verified, foundational-triple-only on every pin,
with two concrete Robertson witnesses.

**Tier-2 honesty (load-bearing).** Every LF4 result that lands on a specific
Born weight does so on a fibre partition **carved by construction** to that
value: `kMuPsi_kRegion` makes `fibreArc (P_st)` have volume `P_st`;
`spectralRegion` is cut to length `‖⟨uᵢ,ψ⟩‖²`. So `bridge_op_p` and
`diracProd_spectralRegion` are *proved* but realise the Born value rather than
*derive* it. The genuine content is (a) the partition is genuinely disjoint, and
(b) the ontic Lebesgue-integral route and the Hilbert Parseval route meet at the
same number through structurally distinct machinery. **`Φ := id` in every
concrete `SectorData`** — no dynamics is exercised (structural debt D1, wide
open). LF4 is a faithful *realisation* on a compact-Kähler Σ, not a *derivation*
of quantum weights from deterministic dynamics. Say which side of that line any
new result sits on.

**Carve-out / Born-from-Kähler-volume programme (the moment-map cluster).** The
modules `KahlerFlow`, `MomentMap`, `BornVolume`, `MomentPushforward`, `BornFS`,
`QubitBornFrequency` address the carve-out issue (the Tier-2 note above: LF4
results land on Born weights via *carved* regions). They establish, on the
genuine Fubini–Study Kähler structure, **not** by carving and **not** via
`busch_effect_gleason`:

- Born weight = torus moment-map coordinate `Φ([ψ])ᵢ = ‖⟨eᵢ,ψ⟩‖²`
  (`momentMap_mk_eq_inner_sq`) — a forced symplectic invariant.
- Born weight = barycentric Lebesgue-volume ratio (`born_eq_volume_ratio`),
  general `N`, unconditional.
- For the qubit, Born weight = genuine `fubiniStudyMeasure` volume ratio on
  `Σ = ℂℙ¹` (`fs_born_volume_ratio_qubit`) and the **Busch-free empirical chain**
  `qubit_born_frequency_convergence` (LF1 typicality + Born = FS volume ⟹
  frequencies → Born), each carried in two forms: conditional on `h_uniform` (the
  `N=2` Duistermaat–Heckman fact `Φ∗μ_FS = uniform[0,1]`) and **unconditional**
  (`*_uncond` in `MomentUniform.lean`) since `h_uniform` was discharged to the
  theorem `fs_moment_pushforward_uniform` (plan B CLOSED 2026-05-31, Gaussian +
  FS-uniqueness route).

**General-`N` Duistermaat–Heckman / Born-from-Kähler-volume CLOSED (2026-06-02).**
The qubit result above is extended to all `N` (files `MomentBridgeN`,
`MomentDirichletN`, `MomentBornN`, `BornFrequencyN`, and the Cat-1 staging
`Mathlib/MeasureTheory/PiCurry.lean`), **unconditionally** — the qubit `h_uniform`
is now the proved headline:

- `fs_moment_joint_dirichlet_N` (`MomentDirichletN.lean`): the **joint** DH law
  `(ratioN ∘ momentMap)∗ μ_FS = M!·vol|_{simplex}` on `ℂℙ^M` (Dirichlet(1,…,1)).
  Route: Gaussian→Dirichlet (`gaussianCPN = fubiniStudy` + `map_pi_eq_stdGaussian`
  + the product-index curry `blockSqNormCurry_map_pi` → `Exp(1/2)^{⊗N}` + the ratio
  → Dirichlet crux). The scalar marginal is only `Beta(1,N−1)` for `N≥3`; only the
  joint law feeds Born.
- `fs_born_volume_ratio_N` + `fs_born_volume_ratio_N_apex` (`MomentBornN.lean`):
  Born = genuine FS-volume ratio of the barycentric regions, **all `N` coordinates**
  (free coords via `replaceMap`, the dropped apex via the affine apex map,
  `det = 1 − ∑b' = b_M`). Unconditional.
- `born_frequency_convergence_N` (`BornFrequencyN.lean`): the general-`N` analogue
  of `qubit_born_frequency_convergence_uncond` — i.i.d. trials from `μ_FS` ⟹
  frequencies → the full Born vector jointly a.s. **Foundational-triple-only, no
  `busch_effect_gleason`.**

This is a *foundational* strengthening (where the Born numbers come from), upstream
of both Empirical branches: the QM branch takes Born probabilities as inner
products; the CSD-bridge branch imports them via Busch/operational consistency;
this cluster now *derives* the Born weight from the Kähler volume **for every `N`**,
unconditionally and Gleason-free. **This is a relocation of the primitive, not its
elimination.** The ontic derivation produces Born from the posited quantum-effective
sector symmetry, which is the **A5** datum (`SectorData.(π, G)`, AXIOMS.md §3.3), not
from nothing. Honest hierarchy: **G3b** (Born as a volume ratio) is dischargeable now
for rank-1 projective measurements *modulo* **A5**; **A5** (the `(π, G)` sector posited)
is the residual primitive, instantiated-but-not-discharged in LF4; **A5 reduces to D1**
(the sector from deterministic dynamics, `Φ = id` today, the deepest open debt). So the
honest payoff is "Born is a theorem of the sector symmetry," with the cost named
(primitive moves from operational effect-additivity to the geometric sector posit). The
general-`N` Born-region forms originally assumed a fully-generic `ψ` (no vanishing
amplitude); that genericity is **retired** by the unconditional engine
(`LF4/BornRegionUncond.lean`, 2026-06-11 — `*_uncond` variants valid for every unit
`ψ`, zero-weight cells handled by the det-0 null-image branch; additive, audited
originals untouched). General POVMs **are** covered geometrically since the POVM
tranche (2026-06-03, `canonicalNaimark`; see the POVM note above).
`busch_effect_gleason` still lives in the corpus as the *operational-stratum*
closure (the LF3 chain capstones and the LF2 general-effect representation use it); this
cluster is the *ontic-stratum, Gleason-free route*, not a removal of Busch. The full
plan and per-result honesty ledger live in `specs/general-n-dh-plan.md` (general `N`)
and `specs/carve-out-plan.md` (qubit / diagnosis).

### LF5: measurement dynamics (the D1 frontier; single-system projective tier COMPLETE 2026-06-11)

LF5 is the layer where measurement *dynamics* is exercised: a deterministic,
FS-measure-preserving von Neumann **de-isolation flow `Φ_vN ≠ id`** on the dilated
projective ontic space realises the Naimark dilation dynamically, and its
context-fixed pointer-block volumes / a.s. empirical frequencies are the Born
weights — for every unit preparation. Built under the de-isolation reading of
`specs/carve-out-plan.md` §6; plan and per-stage honesty ledger in
`specs/lf5-plan.md` (LF5-A..E all DONE).

LF5 module chain (under `CsdLean4/LF5/`, namespace `CSD.LF5`):

                         Z₁Z₂,Z₂Z₃ are computational-basis-diagonal ⟹ syndrome =

                         coarse-grained (8 pointer blocks → 4 syndrome blocks, no new

                         Born numbers reused, A5 posited, decoherence/partial-trace
                         (system→env volume loss) gated on the entangled tier
```

The engine half of LF5-F lives in `LF4/BornRegionDisjoint.lean`:
`bornRegion_pairwiseDisjoint` (the moment-subdivision is a genuine partition,
every ψ ≠ 0), the per-microstate `bornOutcome : CPN (M+1) → Option (Fin (M+1))`
(+ `bornOutcome_preimage_some` / `_measurable` / `_ae_isSome`), a.e. coverage
`bornRegion_ae_cover`, and the indicator-of-disjoint-union bridge
`indicator_iUnion_disjoint`.

**LF5 honest scope.** Single-system projective tier only. The Born *number* is
reused from the FS-volume engine (not re-derived); A5 (FS typicality on the
dilated sector) is posited; the contextual outcome-map slot of
`LF3/ContextMap.lean` is now realised **both dynamically and definitionally** —
LF5-F (2026-06-14) discharges the per-microstate outcome *function*
(`vnPointerOutcome`, deterministic, total off an FS-null set, measurable fibres)
on `bornRegion` pairwise disjointness, upgrading the capstone's conjunct (5) from
outcome *statistics* (a sum of cell frequencies) to a single union event per
pointer; the cell *shapes* remain ψ'-dependent (engine realisation, measures
forced by Kähler geometry). **LF5-G (2026-06-15, `SyndromeFlow.lean`)** is the first
*structured-measurement* application: the 3-qubit bit-flip code's syndrome readout as a
coarse-grained de-isolation flow (the stabilisers are computational-basis-diagonal, so the
syndrome is a fixed `synClass : Fin 8 → Fin 4` and `Φ_syn` is `measurementFlow 8`
coarse-grained), syndrome-block FS volume = syndrome Born weight, with the deterministic
codeword syndrome + recovery. Still the projective / coherent-error tier: the decoherence
(system→environment volume-loss / partial-trace) origin of QEC stays gated on the entangled
tier. Remaining D1 strata: entangled / non-local de-isolation (Bell forces non-locality),
the decoherence/partial-trace error model, the A5 sector origin, and the concrete
`SectorData` instances (which still carry `Φ = id`). All LF5 results are
foundational-triple-only and AxiomAudit-pinned.

### Empirical: QM-validity regression suite

Under `CsdLean4/Empirical/`, namespace `Empirical`. Two branches:

- `Empirical/QM/` — pure QM-validity content (inner-product geometry, no CSD
  ontology). Bell/CHSH at Tsirelson, no-cloning (Wootters-Zurek + Dieks),
  no-deleting (Pati-Braunstein), superdense coding, quantum money, Stern-Gerlach,
  uncertainty, Kochen-Specker (Cabello-18), Mermin-Peres, GHZ, Hardy, and
  single/two/multi-qubit gates. Every theorem foundational-triple-only and
  AxiomAudit-pinned.
- `Empirical/QM/Algorithms/` — the quantum-algorithm tier (complete 2026-06-08,

  eigenstructure + phase estimation ideal `r∣T` + Dirichlet `≥4/π²` bound),
  recovery + factoring (`ShorRecovery.lean`), random-`a` success ≥ 1/2 for
  arbitrary odd composite `N` (`ShorRandomA.lean`, indexed-CRT counting), and the

- `Empirical/CSD/` — CSD volume-ratio readings: transport each QM-validity
  statement through a `CSDBridge.Context D` bundle carrying the LF2 `SectorData`
  + measure-bridge data, providing the structural slot for the CSD-ontic
  interpretation. Several bundles carry load-bearing undischarged realisability
  fields (`bridge_isometry`, observable-correspondence; LF4-todo §13/§14) marked
  with `Status: load-bearing, externally supplied, undischarged`.

### `Mathlib/` staging tree

`CsdLean4/Mathlib/` holds Cat-1 (CSD-free) helpers staged as Mathlib upstream
candidates — `Projectivization` topology/measure/lift API and the
`UnitaryGroup` / Fubini-Study uniqueness chain (which gives the axiom-free
concrete realisation `invariant_measure_uniqueness_cpn`); the `QuantumInfo/`
subtree (the n-qubit `Register`/`prob` Born, `Hadamard`, `Fourier`/QFT
unitarity, CPTP `Channel`s, `TraceDistance`, `QEC/` codes) consumed by the
algorithm tier; and `MeasureTheory/PiCurry.lean` (the general-`N` DH bridge).
These files keep the **natural Mathlib namespace** (`namespace Projectivization`,
`namespace Matrix`, `namespace QuantumInfo`), not a CSD wrapper; the
`CsdLean4/Mathlib/<path>/` location is the only staging signal (CONVENTIONS.md §1
Cat-1).

**LF4 TODO list:** items deferred from LF2 / LF3 to LF4 are recorded in
`specs/LF4-todo.md` (§14.2 now closed; §13 isometry realisability, §8 additional
preparation classes, §1-§11 remaining). The LF3 chain bundle hypotheses
(`MeasurementJointEig.born_eq_P_st`, `PureSingletPreparation.bridge_op_p`)
discharge through items §2, §3, §7. Read that file before starting LF4 work; the
pre-LF4 plan and execution log live at `specs/pre-LF4-plan.md`.

## Lean / Mathlib conventions

- `sorry`-free proofs are required; `lake build` failing or any `sorry` means the formalization is incomplete.
- Mathlib's `MeasureTheory` namespace is used throughout. Lean elaboration order matters — structure field order in `OnticSetup` and `TrialModel` is load-bearing.
- When adding new lemmas, place them in the module where their primary definition lives; keep the dependency chain linear (no circular imports).
- `hΩ0_nonzero : (μL : Measure SigmaSpace) Ω0 ≠ 0` is a hypothesis threaded through many definitions — it prevents division-by-zero in `prepMeasure` and is required wherever conditional measure values are rewritten.
- `hΦ_pres : MeasurePreserving Φ μL μL` (Liouville's theorem) is structural ontic input on `OnticSetup`, but inside LF1, LF2, and LF3 **only its measurability content is used** (extracted via `measurable_Φ`). Grep confirms no current proof in the corpus invokes the preservation content. The full property is carried for physical admissibility of the ontic model and becomes load-bearing only when LF4 derives `μL` from a concrete symplectic / Kähler volume form. Until then `hΦ_pres` is structural payload; the LF1 proof is strictly more general than the physical reading suggests. See the `OnticSetup` module docstring in `LF1/Setup.lean` for the honest disclosure.
- `SigmaSpace` in `OnticSetup` is an abstract `MeasurableSpace` — it is **not** specialised to `ℝ^{2n}`, a symplectic manifold, or any concrete phase space. Do not add assumptions that implicitly assume one; concrete instantiation is LF4's job (LF2 keeps `SigmaSpace`/`P`/`G` abstract; `LF4/KahlerInstance.lean` provides the concrete `ℂℙ^{M-1} × T²`).
