Lean 4 formalisation of Constraint-Surface Dynamics. **LF1**, **LF2**, **LF3**, and **LF4 §14.2** (the observable-correspondence layer — Hilbert spectral expansion, ontic-side multi-region carving, ontic ↔ Hilbert variance correspondence, and Robertson uncertainty at the ontic-integration level, including two concrete witnesses) are merged and machine-verified, along with a **general-`N` Born-from-Kähler-volume cluster** (the moment-map / Duistermaat–Heckman programme) and its **extension to general POVMs via Naimark dilation**. An **Empirical** module provides the QM-validity regression suite (Bell family + Tsirelson, no-cloning / -deleting / -broadcasting / -communication, E91 device-independent security, Robertson uncertainty, Stern-Gerlach, unambiguous state discrimination, superdense coding, teleportation, quantum money, contextuality, Hardy, GHZ, gates) plus a carving-free, Gleason-free **CSD volume-frequency series** (Stern-Gerlach, Malus, Bell, GHZ, Hardy projective; trine, USD, SIC non-projective POVMs — each Born value *derived* as a Fubini–Study volume). **[`EMPIRICAL.md`](EMPIRICAL.md) is the per-test index** for both branches.

**Headline result — the Born rule as a Kähler typicality volume, for *general quantum measurements*.** The Born weight `‖⟨eᵢ, ψ⟩‖²` is derived from the Fubini–Study Kähler geometry of the ontic `Σ = ℂℙ^{N-1}` — as the **torus moment-map coordinate** (`momentMap_mk_eq_inner_sq`), as a **barycentric Lebesgue-volume ratio** (`born_eq_volume_ratio`), and, **for every `N`, unconditionally**, as a **genuine `fubiniStudyMeasure` volume ratio** (`fs_born_volume_ratio_N`) carrying a **Gleason-free empirical chain** `born_frequency_convergence_N`: deterministic repeated-trial typicality (LF1) + Born = Fubini–Study volume ⟹ frequencies converge a.s. to the Born weight, the Born value *derived from the Kähler volume* rather than imported via Gleason/Busch. **This now covers non-projective measurements:** every **POVM** `{Eᵢ}` acquires a canonical Naimark dilation `canonicalNaimark P` (built from the CFC square roots `√Eᵢ`), and `povm_born_frequency_volume` lands the POVM Born weight `⟨ψ, Eᵢ ψ⟩` as a sum of Fubini–Study volumes on the dilated `Σ' = ℂℙ^{N·|ι|−1}` — empirical frequencies converging to it, **carving-free, Gleason-free, and unconditional**. So the Born rule for *arbitrary* quantum measurements is a **theorem of the (posited) sector geometry on `Σ`**, not of operational effect-additivity (Busch). Honest residue: this **relocates** the primitive rather than eliminating it — Born becomes a theorem of the *posited sector structure* on `Σ` (the projection and symmetry data, enlarged by the ancilla for POVMs), which in turn rests on the *deterministic dynamics*: in every concrete instance today the flow is the identity, i.e. no measurement dynamics is yet exercised — the deepest open question, and one that calls for further theoretical development before the Lean side can advance.

The repo is sorry-free and `lake build CsdLeanTests` green. **What CSD commits you to is a physical posture, not an axiom count.** The theory's postulates are: an ontic substrate `(Σ, μL)` carrying a deterministic, measure-preserving flow; a posited projection onto the quantum-effective sector together with its symmetry; and the reading of probability as a typicality volume. From these the **Born rule is derived as a theorem** — Gleason-free, general dimension, including general POVMs — rather than assumed. These postulates are carried as hypotheses on the types (CSD's claims are conditional on the substrate existing), so they do not appear in `#print axioms`; the deepest open one is the *dynamical origin of the sector* (`Φ = id` in every concrete instance today). Separately, the **formalisation** rests on the foundational Lean triple (`propext`, `Classical.choice`, `Quot.sound`) and **one imported standard mathematical result** (`busch_effect_gleason`, the Busch effect-Gleason theorem) not yet in Mathlib — **library debt, not a theory commitment**, confined to the operational stratum and **not** in the ontic Born derivation (which is Gleason-free, projective *and* POVM). The second former import, invariant-measure uniqueness, was **removed 2026-06-04**: nothing downstream used the abstract statement that carried it, and its concrete `ℂℙ^{N-1}` content is a proved axiom-free theorem in the tree. See [`AXIOMS.md`](AXIOMS.md) §0 for this three-category distinction and the per-theorem ledger, and [`specs/povm-plan.md`](specs/povm-plan.md) / [`specs/LF4-todo.md`](specs/LF4-todo.md) for the POVM tranche and LF4 backlog.

## What's machine-verified

| Layer | Headline | Carving | Axioms beyond foundational triple |
|---|---|---|---|
| **LF5 measurement dynamics (in progress)** | The D1 frontier (`specs/lf5-plan.md`): LF5-A `vnUnitary` — the von Neumann coupling permutation unitary (copy `eⱼ⊗a₀ ↦ eⱼ⊗aⱼ`, manifestly unitary); LF5-B `measurementFlow` — the **first measurement flow `Φ_vN ≠ id`** on the dilated `ℂℙ^{N·N−1}`, Fubini–Study measure-preserving (`measurementFlow_measurePreserving`, `measurementFlow_ne_id`, `measurementFlow_mk_single`); LF5-C `vnNaimark` — the **dynamically-realised Naimark dilation** of the computational-basis projective POVM: `V = U_vN ∘ (·⊗a₀)` is an isometry with pointer-block pullback `Vᴴ Πᵢ V = \|eᵢ⟩⟨eᵢ\|` (`vnDilationV_isom`, `vnDilationV_pullback`), and the flow carries the embedded ray to the dilated ray (`measurementFlow_realises_dilation`). LF5-D/E (Born = volume + frequency on the flow, capstone) open — note `Vψ` vanishes off the diagonal cells, so LF5-D needs a zero-amplitude-tolerant volume reading, not a blind `hpos` instantiation | **No carving** — pointer regions are the context-fixed `blockProj` apparatus blocks; the Born number is reused from the FS-volume engine (not re-derived), per the de-isolation reading (carve-out-plan §6) | none |
| **LF4 Born-from-volume** | Born weight `‖⟨eᵢ,ψ⟩‖²` = torus moment-map coordinate (`momentMap_mk_eq_inner_sq`) = barycentric volume ratio (`born_eq_volume_ratio`, general `N`) = genuine FS-volume ratio on `Σ=ℂℙ¹` (`fs_born_volume_ratio_qubit`); Busch-free empirical chain (`qubit_born_frequency_convergence`; general-`N` joint form `born_frequency_convergence_partition`) — frequencies → Born via the Kähler volume; unconditional qubit forms `*_uncond` | **No carving** — geometric regions (moment sublevel / barycentric sub-simplex); Born value derived, not cut to fit | none (the `N=2` DH fact `fs_moment_pushforward_uniform` is a discharged **theorem**, plan B closed; the general-`N` extension `fs_moment_joint_dirichlet_N` / `fs_born_volume_ratio_N` / `born_frequency_convergence_N` is likewise foundational-triple-only) |
| **LF4 POVM (Naimark)** | General (non-projective) measurements: every POVM has a canonical Naimark dilation `canonicalNaimark P` (from CFC square roots `√Eᵢ`); `povm_born_eq_dilated_volume` lands the POVM Born weight `⟨ψ,Eᵢψ⟩` as a sum of FS volumes on the dilated `Σ'=ℂℙ^{N·\|ι\|−1}`; `povm_born_frequency_volume` — empirical frequencies → POVM Born weight | **No carving** — dilated barycentric block regions; Born value derived. Honest scope: dilation enlarges the posited `Σ` by the ancilla; genericity `hpos` assumed | none (Gleason-free; `busch_effect_gleason` no longer on the ontic POVM path) |
| **LF4 §14.2** | `kahler_robertson_ontic_variance` — Robertson bound on ontic-side integrals for any Hermitian observables on `EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin N)`, with concrete witnesses `pauli_xy_robertson_saturation` (saturation at \|0⟩) and `pauliDot_robertson_zPlus` (parametric over axes) | Compact Kähler `KSigma M = ℂℙ^{M-1} × T²`; N-arc fibre partition via `spectralRegion`; integration headline `∫ spectralOnticCentered dμψ = ‖A ψ‖² − ⟨A⟩²` | none |
| **LF3** | Singlet kernel `P_st = (1 − st a·b)/4`; LF1↔LF2↔LF3 chain capstones (6 variants); finite-leakage stability | Posited fibre law `μψ` (option (B) chain design, post-Phase-7) | none (chain re-routed off Busch 2026-06-02; `busch_effect_gleason` retained for the operational-stratum statements) |
| **LF2** | measure bridge `π∗μL = c·μFS` (axiom-free on the concrete instances, `cp_measure_bridge` / `k_measure_bridge`); `born_quadratic` (`Tr(\|ψ⟩⟨ψ\|·\|φ⟩⟨φ\|) = ‖⟨ψ,φ⟩‖²`); `pure_state_born_weights_of_certainty`; `LF1_main_theorem_projective` | Abstract projective target `P` (concrete instantiation deferred to LF4 §8) | `busch_effect_gleason` (purity-form Born only; the abstract-bridge `invariant_measure_uniqueness` was removed 2026-06-04) |
| **LF1** | `LF1_main_theorem_ae` — empirical frequencies converge a.s. to ontic weight under deterministic flow + pairwise-independent i.i.d. preparation | Abstract measurable `SigmaSpace` (no symplectic / Kähler structure assumed) | none |
| **Empirical** | Bell + Tsirelson + No-cloning/-deleting/-broadcasting/-communication + **E91 device-independent security** (the LHV CHSH `\|S\|≤2` bound) + Robertson + Stern-Gerlach + USD + Superdense coding + Teleportation + Quantum money + Mermin-Peres + KS18 + Hardy + GHZ + gates; plus the **CSD volume-frequency series** (SG, Malus, Bell, GHZ, Hardy projective; trine, USD, SIC POVMs — Born values *derived* as FS volumes). Per-test index: [`EMPIRICAL.md`](EMPIRICAL.md) | Two-layer: QM-validity (inner-product geometry) + CSD-side (volume-ratio readings / transport bundles) | foundational triple only on every Empirical pin |
| **Algorithms** | n-qubit register + **Deutsch-Jozsa** (1-query constant/balanced), **Grover** (`sin²((2k+1)θ)` amplitude amplification), **QFT** (`qft_unitary`, finite unitary via roots-of-unity orthogonality), and the **full Shor's algorithm** end to end: order-finding by phase estimation (ideal `r∣T` + Dirichlet `≥4/π²` bound), period recovery, factoring from a nontrivial `√1`, and random-`a` success `≥ 1/2` for *arbitrary odd composite `N`* (`shor_factor_prob_ge`). Per-test index: [`EMPIRICAL.md`](EMPIRICAL.md) | QM-validity (inner-product geometry; `prob = ‖·‖²`). Finite-dimensional throughout — no field theory | foundational triple only on every pin; Tier-A adversarially audited SOUND |

Every theorem listed is AxiomAudit-pinned via `#guard_msgs` in `CsdLean4/Tests/AxiomAudit.lean`; the build fails on axiom drift.

## Quick start

```bash
# Library (LF1+LF2+LF3+LF4+Empirical, no tests):
lake build

# Tests target (AxiomAudit pins + Examples):
lake build CsdLeanTests

# Type-check a single file:
lake env lean CsdLean4/LF4/PauliDotRobertson.lean
```

Toolchain: Lean 4.29.0-rc8 (see `lean-toolchain`); Mathlib4. CI builds both targets on every push to `main` and on PRs.

The canonical top-level import is `CsdLean4` (explicit module list — not glob). For downstream consumers `import CsdLean4.Basic` transitively pulls in the LF1 → LF2 → LF3 → LF4 → Empirical chain.

## LF4 — observable correspondence and Robertson uncertainty (§14.2)

LF4 is the layer where projective objects acquire ontic content via a concrete Kähler instance. The §14.2 sub-target — the **observable-correspondence theorem**, lifting self-adjoint Hilbert operators to measurable Σ-valued functions whose integral against the preparation measure matches the Hilbert expectation — is fully discharged on the existing compact Kähler instance, with concrete witnesses.

### The §14.2 chain (six commits)

| Commit | Module | Headline |
|---|---|---|
| `eeec1e8` | `LF4/SpectralExpansion.lean` | `hermitian_inner_spectral_expansion` — `⟨ψ, A ψ⟩ = ∑ᵢ λᵢ · ‖⟨uᵢ, ψ⟩‖²` for any Hermitian `A : Matrix (Fin N) (Fin N) ℂ`. Proof: Parseval (`OrthonormalBasis.sum_inner_mul_inner`) + self-adjointness (`Matrix.isHermitian_iff_isSymmetric`) + eigenvalue equation (`LinearMap.IsSymmetric.apply_eigenvectorBasis`, bridged to the Matrix-level reindexed basis as Mathlib's `Matrix.Spectrum` does internally) |
| `dec11e5` | `LF4/SpectralCarving.lean` | Multi-region carving infrastructure (`fibreShiftedArc`, `cumWeights`, `spectralRegion`) + integration headline `integral_spectralOntic_eq_inner_re` — `∫ spectralOntic dμψ = re ⟨ψ, A ψ⟩`. The pre-existing `fibreArc ℓ = (0, ℓ]` is anchored at 0, so distinct arcs are nested; the shifted-anchor primitive gives genuinely disjoint N-arc partitions |
| `fe717ed` | `LF4/SpectralVariance.lean` | `spectralVariance := ∑ᵢ (λᵢ − ⟨A⟩)² · bornWeights i` and the composite headline `integral_spectralOnticCentered_eq_hilbert_norm_sq_diff` — `∫ spectralOnticCentered dμψ = ‖A ψ‖² − ⟨A⟩²` (the standard QM variance form for self-adjoint A) |
| `63fe1b0` | `LF4/UncertaintyKahler.lean` | `kahler_robertson_ontic_variance` — Robertson bound with **ontic-side LHS**: `(∫ spectralOnticCentered hA ψ dμψ) · (∫ spectralOnticCentered hB ψ dμψ) ≥ ¼ ‖⟨ψ, [A, B] ψ⟩‖²`. Bridges QM-side `variance` (norm-sub-sq form) to spectral form via `variance_eq_norm_sq_sub_expectation_sq` and composes with `Empirical.Uncertainty.robertson_uncertainty` |
| `59eba66` | `LF4/PauliRobertson.lean` | First concrete witness: `pauli_xy_robertson_saturation` — `σ_x, σ_y` on `|0⟩` saturates Robertson with both sides equal to 1. The canonical textbook example, machine-verified |
| `c5eed61` | `LF4/PauliDotRobertson.lean` | Parametric generalisation: `pauliDot_robertson_zPlus â b̂ p₀` — `(1 − a_z²)(1 − b_z²) ≥ (a_x b_y − a_y b_x)²` for arbitrary unit-vector axes (the `DetectorSetting` constraint). Both sides explicit polynomials in the axis components |

The Kähler instance is `KSigma M = CPN M × KTorus = ℂℙ^{M-1} × (AddCircle 1 × AddCircle 1)` with `kMuL = fubiniStudyMeasure p₀ ⊗ vol_T²`. The preparation measure for §14.2 is `(Measure.dirac p₀) ⊗ vol_T²` (Dirac on the base ray × Haar on the fibre).

### What §14.2 unlocks

- **Uncertainty bundle's ontic-variance match**: pre-LF4 `csd_robertson_uncertainty` was a transport theorem (any Hilbert state satisfies Robertson). With `kahler_robertson_ontic_variance`, the physical content — ontic variances satisfy Robertson, not just Hilbert variances — is realisable for any concrete pair of bounded Hermitian observables.
- **Any multi-eigenvalue observable**: spin-1 components, GHZ stabiliser generators, generic Hermitian operators. The spectral pattern works beyond ±1 / projector cases.
- **Variance identity in spectral form**: `Var_ψ(A) = ∑ᵢ (λᵢ − ⟨A⟩)² · ‖⟨uᵢ, ψ⟩‖²`, with `bornWeights ψ A i = ‖⟨uᵢ, ψ⟩‖²` summing to `‖ψ‖²` via `OrthonormalBasis.sum_sq_norm_inner_right`.

### LF4 design choices (post-§14.2)

- `SectorData` (LF2) is the abstract layer; the compact Kähler instance is `KSigma M` defined in `LF4/KahlerInstance.lean`, with `fubiniStudyMeasure p₀` (Dirac at `p₀ : CPN M`) and `vol_T²` (Haar on the flat torus). Fibre arcs are subsets of `AddCircle 1` carved via `equivIoc 1 0`.
- The `fibreShiftedArc c ℓ := (equivIoc 1 0)⁻¹' (Ioc c (c+ℓ))` primitive replaces the nested `fibreArc ℓ = (0, ℓ]` from `SingletKahler.lean` for genuinely-disjoint N-arc partitions. Volume = `ENNReal.ofReal ℓ` for `[c, c+ℓ] ⊆ [0,1]`; disjoint when underlying intervals are disjoint.
- `cumWeights w : Fin (N+1) → ℝ` is defined via `Finset.filter` (not `Nat.rec`) for clean `Finset.sum_insert` proofs of the succ-castSucc step and `cumWeights_last = ∑ w`.
- The variance bridge `variance_eq_norm_sq_sub_expectation_sq` uses `norm_sub_sq` + `Complex.mul_conj` + `Complex.normSq_apply` to derive `Var = ‖Aψ‖² − (re ⟨A⟩)²` from the standard QM `Var = ‖Aψ − ⟨A⟩ψ‖²` definition for symmetric `T` and unit `ψ`.
- Robertson on ontic variances is `kahler_robertson_ontic_variance`; its proof composes `QM_variance_eq_integral_spectralOnticCentered` (the spectral bridge applied twice) with the existing QM-side `Empirical.Uncertainty.robertson_uncertainty` (Cauchy-Schwarz + commutator algebra).

### LF4 backlog (`specs/LF4-todo.md`)

§14.2 is **closed**. Remaining LF4 work:

- **§13** — isometry realisability (cloning / deletion / N-qubit unitaries as Σ-flows). Partial; cloning + deletion bundles in place.
- **§8** — concrete `SectorData` constructions for additional preparation classes (mixed-state, multi-particle).
- **§1-§11** — see `specs/LF4-todo.md` for the full backlog (preparation-to-Hilbert correspondence, projective-first outcome specification, etc.).

## LF3 — singlet kernel and the LF1↔LF2↔LF3 empirical chain

LF3 sits on top of LF2 and delivers the **first concrete CSD-ontic prediction** beyond the abstract `SectorData` layer: the singlet kernel `P_st(a, b) = (1 − s·t·a·b)/4` and its four operational consequences (correlation `−a·b`, marginals `1/2`, no-signalling on each side, pointer-completeness), with finite-leakage stability of all four.

### Headline deliverables

1. **Singlet kernel algebraic core** — `cst_squared_eq : ‖cAmp s t (a, b)‖² = (1 − st·a·b)/4`, with `cAmp := (Real.sqrt P_st : ℂ)` as the v1.00 closed-form representative.
2. **Eight-conjunct strong-readout package** — `LF3_main_theorem`. Kernel + correlation + marginals + no-signalling + pointer-completeness in one statement.
3. **Finite-leakage four-conjunct package** — `LF3_finite_leakage_theorem`. Each quantity deviates from its strong-readout value by at most `εA + εB + εA·εB` (with explicit prefactors). Stability-from-assumption (the deviation bound enters as a field of `LeakageCompat`, not a first-principles derivation).
4. **Six chain capstones** — three per-sector + three joint-partition Phase 8 variants:
   - `LF3_singlet_frequency_convergence` (pre-Born, lands on `P_st`),
   - `LF3_singlet_frequency_convergence_born` (closed-form Born, lands on `‖cAmp‖²`),
   - `LF3_singlet_frequency_convergence_born_inner` (bra-ket form, lands on `‖⟨v, ψ⁻⟩‖²` for caller-supplied joint spin eigenstate `v`),
   - plus `..._joint`, `..._born_joint`, `..._born_inner_joint` (joint AE over `Sign × Sign`).

All six chain capstones consume a `PureSingletPreparation D ctx N` bundle (option (B) form, post-Phase 7), whose load-bearing hypotheses are `MeasurementJointEig.born_eq_P_st` (Born identity for joint spin eigenstates) and `PureSingletPreparation.bridge_op_p` (ontic-weight ↔ OP.p bridge). The bundle's `weight_eq_P_st` theorem composes the two.

### LF3 axiom posture (post Phase 7, 2026-05-18)

- `LF3_main_theorem` and `LF3_finite_leakage_theorem` cite **only** the foundational triple.
- The six chain capstones are now **foundational-triple-only** (re-routed off Busch, 2026-06-02): `weight_eq_P_st` routes the chain bridge through the Busch-free `OP_p_at_jointEig_eq_P_st_direct` (the ontic-stratum, direct volume-ratio Born step). The Busch-mediated twin `OP_p_at_jointEig_eq_P_st` remains as the operational-stratum statement. So the LF3 empirical chain is Gleason-free; `busch_effect_gleason` is now cited only by the operational-stratum statements (`pure_state_born_weights_of_certainty`, `born_rank_one`, `OP_p_at_jointEig_eq_P_st`, `ontic_born_frequency`). See [`AXIOMS.md`](AXIOMS.md) §2.4.
- The measure bridge carries **no axiom** on the chain capstones: the concrete instances supply it axiom-free (`cp_measure_bridge` / `k_measure_bridge`). The abstract `measure_bridge` and the `invariant_measure_uniqueness` axiom it required were removed 2026-06-04.

The full per-theorem audit is in [`AXIOMS.md`](AXIOMS.md) §3.6 and §5. Regression-protection via `CsdLean4/Tests/AxiomAudit.lean`'s `#guard_msgs` against `#print axioms`.

### Posted-fibre-measure migration (2026-05-25)

The preparation primitive at LF3 is a posited fibre trial law `μψ` (option (B)), not the ambient `μL`-conditional `prepMeasure`: under the continuous measure bridge `π∗μL = c·μFS`, every state's fibre is μL-null, so a μL-conditional pure preparation is uninhabitable. The capstones take i.i.d. trials with common law `μψ` and route through `LF1.freq_tendsto_of_iid` (not `LF1_main_theorem_ae`). See `LF4-todo §8`.

---

## LF2 — sector-conditional measure bridge and Born-weight wrapper

LF2 connects LF1's ontic volume weights to projective Born-form probabilities under explicit symmetry and operational hypotheses.

### What LF2 delivers

1. **Measure bridge** — `π∗ μL = c · μFS` for some `c : ENNReal`, under symmetry-compatible `SectorData`. Internal proof of `G`-invariance of `π∗ μL`, then uniqueness of the invariant measure. On the concrete instances the bridge holds **axiom-free** (`cp_measure_bridge` / `k_measure_bridge`, `c = 1`); the abstract over-general statement and its `invariant_measure_uniqueness` import were removed 2026-06-04 (the `ℂℙ^{N-1}` uniqueness is itself a proved axiom-free theorem).
2. **LF1 ↔ LF2 weight identity** — `μprep(π⁻¹(O_ep)) = projectiveWeight D μprep O_ep`. The structural hinge.
3. **Combined LF1 + LF2 theorem** — `LF1_main_theorem_projective`. LF1 empirical frequency converges almost surely to the real-valued projective weight under the outcome correspondence `O.preEvent = π⁻¹(O_ep)`.
4. **Born quadratic form** — `born_quadratic`. For unit `ψ, φ : EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin N)`, `Tr(|ψ⟩⟨ψ| · |φ⟩⟨φ|) = ‖⟨ψ, φ⟩‖²`. Genuine Lean proof via trace-of-outer-product + `Complex.mul_conj`.
5. **Pure-state Born weights from certainty** — `pure_state_born_weights_of_certainty`. Given an `OP` that is "certain" at `|ψ⟩`, for every unit `φ` the probability is `‖⟨ψ, φ⟩‖²`. Composes `busch_effect_gleason` + `rankOneDensity_unique_of_certainty` (now proved, no longer axiomatic) + `born_quadratic`.

### LF2 axiom posture

| Axiom | Role | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `busch_effect_gleason` | Effect-additive probability on finite-dim `N ≥ 2` admits a unique trace-form density | Spec-mandated; not in Mathlib. **The only imported axiom** — `invariant_measure_uniqueness` was removed 2026-06-04 (the abstract bridge it served was unused; the concrete `ℂℙ^{N-1}` uniqueness is a proved theorem). |

`rankOneDensity_unique_of_certainty` was carried as a third axiom in earlier revisions; **now a proved theorem** (discharged 2026-05-18) via `Matrix.PosSemidef.dotProduct_mulVec_zero_iff` — `(I − P) ρ (I − P) = 0` from the certainty hypothesis, then `ρ = P ρ P = Tr(M·P) • P` via the rank-1 sandwich identity. Proof in `CsdLean4/LF2/BornWrapper.lean`.

LF1 theorems remain axiom-free beyond Lean's standard triple. Several LF2 theorems — including `born_quadratic` and `LF1_main_theorem_projective` — depend on the single LF2 axiom (`busch_effect_gleason`) **not at all**.

### Design choices in LF2

- `SectorData` is parametric in `(SigmaSpace, P, G)`. The projective target is kept abstract — no `Projectivization`, no Fubini–Study measure constructed. Concrete instantiation is LF4 §8's job.
- `μFS` is **not** a field of `SectorData`; it enters via the `MeasureBridgeData` bundle as an explicit argument, keeping `SectorData` `μFS`-agnostic.
- `Effect` and `DensityOperator` are concrete `Matrix (Fin N) (Fin N) ℂ` structures (not opaque stubs). This gives `born_quadratic` real Lean content.
- `Effect.add` takes the `le_one` hypothesis explicitly; avoids `Option`-valued addition.
- Spec Def 5.1 clause 3 (unitary covariance) is **not** a field on `OperationalPackage` — the literal invariance over-constrains, the covariant reading is type-heavy. Deferred to LF4.

## LF1 — deterministic repeated-trial typicality theorem

For a finite-measure ontic state space `(Σ, μL)`, measurable preparation region `Ω0 ⊂ Σ`, measurable outcome partition `{Ω_i^Σ}`, and deterministic `μL`-preserving flow `Φ_t`: LF1 studies repeated trials whose initial microstates are sampled independently from the conditional preparation measure on `Ω0`.

### Headline theorem

```lean
theorem LF1_main_theorem_ae
    (T : S.TrialModel Ω)
    (O : S.OutcomeRegion)
    (hindep :
      Pairwise
        (Function.onFun
          (fun f g : Ω → ℝ => IndepFun f g T.trialMeasure)
          (fun n => T.indicatorRV (S := S) O n))) :
    ∀ᵐ ω ∂ T.trialMeasure,
      Tendsto (T.empiricalFreq O · ω) atTop (nhds O.weightReal)
```

Empirical frequencies converge `μ`-almost surely to the real-valued ontic weight under repeated preparation with **pairwise-independent trial indicators**. Pairwise independence is the only non-trivial repeated-trial hypothesis; integrability and identical distribution are automatic from the `TrialModel` structure.

### Deterministic content

LF1 is not merely a law-of-large-numbers on an abstract probability space. The physical content is **deterministic at the ontic level**:

- Each single trial is generated by a deterministic measurable flow `Φ_t : Σ → Σ`.
- The outcome of a single trial is determined by the initial microstate `x ∈ Σ`.
- The outcome event is `x ∈ Φ_t⁻¹(Ω_i^Σ)`.

No stochastic evolution at the ontic level. The only probabilistic ingredient is the repeated-trial preparation model. LF1 is a **deterministic typicality theorem with a probabilistic preparation model**, not an intrinsic-randomness theorem.

### Scope and limitations

`OnticSetup` takes an abstract `SigmaSpace : Type*` — **not** specialised to `ℝ^{2n}`, a symplectic manifold, or any concrete phase space. Physical meanings:

| Field | Physical meaning | Status in v1.00 |
|---|---|---|
| `μL` | Liouville measure | *assumed* as a finite measure |
| `Φ` | Hamiltonian flow | *assumed* as a measurable map |
| `hΦ_pres` | Liouville's theorem | *assumed*; structurally inert through LF3 (see `LF1/Setup.lean`) |
| `Ω0` | Preparation region | *assumed* as a measurable set |

**Structural assumption** (preparation-measure origin): `μL` is asserted as a finite measure; the flow `Φ` is asserted to preserve it; neither is derived from a symplectic / Kähler volume form in v1.00. The LF1 frequency theorem is correspondingly more general than the physical reading suggests. This assumption discharges at the Lean level when LF4 instantiates `SigmaSpace` as a compact Kähler manifold and constructs `μL` from `ω^n / n!` — **partially done** by `LF4/KahlerInstance.lean`, which provides `KSigma M = ℂℙ^{M-1} × T²` with `fubiniStudyMeasure` and `vol_T²` as the concrete instance for §14.2. Deriving the flow itself (rather than asserting it) is a deeper, theory-level question.

## Empirical — QM-validity regression suite

The Empirical module is a **QM-validity layer** regression suite. Each theorem proves that the standard QM formalisation produces the predicted experimental number; the proofs are linear algebra and inner-product geometry, with no ontic substrate at the proof level. CSD's foundational claim — that QM emerges from volume ratios on Σ — is verified at the **CSD-ontic layer** by the LF3 chain capstones and (now) the LF4 §14.2 carving / variance / Robertson chain.

**[`EMPIRICAL.md`](EMPIRICAL.md) is the per-test index** — every validation in both branches with its file, headline theorem, claim, and physics source. The phase table below is the abridged map; `EMPIRICAL.md` is the full enumeration.

### Current Empirical phases

Every Empirical theorem is **foundational-triple-only** and AxiomAudit-pinned. The CSD-side companions in `Empirical/CSD/` transport each QM-validity statement through a `CSDBridge.Context D` bundle, carrying the LF2 `SectorData` + measure-bridge data, providing the structural slot for the CSD-ontic interpretation that LF4 will eventually instantiate via `kahler_robertson_ontic_variance` and similar §14.2 mechanisms.

### Two-layer model: QM-validity vs CSD-ontic

The QM-validity layer is **prerequisite** to the CSD-ontic layer. LF4 §14.2's spectral expansion + carving + integration headline + Robertson chain provides the **lifting mechanism**: any QM-validity statement about expectations and variances of bounded Hermitian observables on `EuclideanSpace ℂ (Fin N)` has a corresponding CSD-ontic statement on `KSigma M`, with the same numerical prediction realised via spectral indicator sums integrated against the preparation measure.

See [`EMPIRICAL.md`](EMPIRICAL.md) for the per-test index, `specs/qm-empirical-tests.md` §0.1 for the full two-layer correspondence statement, and `specs/empirical-csd-bridge-plan.md` for the CSDBridge architecture.

## Genealogy

The LLN-based typicality framing used in LF1 and the geometric quantum mechanics structure on `CP^{N-1}` consumed by LF2 match structures developed independently in the Dürr / Goldstein / Zanghì typicality line and the Kibble / Heslot / Anandan / Ashtekar-Schilling geometric quantum mechanics line. The CSD corpus uses the standard mathematical machinery shared with those programmes (measure theory, finite-dim inner-product geometry, the symplectic-Kähler structure on `CP^{N-1}`), and the Lean tree imports Mathlib accordingly. What is independently rediscovered is the **structural choice of objects**: typicality measures on the ontic phase space for LF1, the Born quadratic form on projective Hilbert space for LF2, and (as of §14.2) the eigenvalue-weighted indicator sum integrated against the fibre measure as the ontic counterpart of Hilbert expectation values. The corpus arrives at those choices from its own internal logic; convergence is offered as a credibility signal rather than a claim of priority.

**General-`N` Duistermaat–Heckman / Born-from-Kähler-volume (the qubit result extended to all `N`, 2026-06-02):**

| Theorem | File | Mathematical meaning | Axioms |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fs_moment_joint_dirichlet_N` | `LF4/MomentDirichletN.lean` | **Joint Duistermaat–Heckman law, general `N`**: `(ratioN ∘ momentMap)∗ μ_FS = M!·vol\|_{simplex}` on `ℂℙ^M` (the Dirichlet(1,…,1) law). The qubit scalar marginal is only `Beta(1,N−1)` for `N≥3`; the joint simplex law is what feeds Born. | none |
| `fs_volume_eq_dirichlet`, `volume_openSimplexFree` | `LF4/MomentBornN.lean` | The DH volume law on `Σ` (`μ_FS` of a moment region `= M!·`its Lebesgue volume); the free simplex has volume `(M!)⁻¹`. | none |

| `measurePreserving_piCurry`, `map_curryProd_pi` | `Mathlib/MeasureTheory/PiCurry.lean` | Cat-1 Mathlib-gap: currying a sigma/product index preserves `Measure.pi`. | none |
| `fs_moment_pushforward_uniform_of_joint_dirichlet` | `LF4/QubitConsistency.lean` | **N=2 consistency cross-check**: the qubit `fs_moment_pushforward_uniform` is kernel-derived from `fs_moment_joint_dirichlet_N (M:=1)` (via the `(Fin 1 → ℝ) ≃ᵐ ℝ` eval iso + `Ioo`/`Icc` null-set bridge), machine-confirming the general-`N` law faithfully generalises the independently-proved qubit result. | none |

The qubit's former `h_uniform` hypothesis is now the **theorem** `fs_moment_joint_dirichlet_N`, so the general-`N` Born-from-volume chain is **unconditional and foundational-triple-only — no `busch_effect_gleason`**. The CSD thesis is realised end-to-end for general `N`: deterministic LF1 typicality + Born = Kähler volume ⟹ frequencies → Born, with Born *derived* from the symplectic geometry rather than imported via Gleason. Plan and honesty ledger: `specs/general-n-dh-plan.md`. Genericity hypothesis on the Born-region forms: `ψ` has no vanishing amplitude.

**Foundational reading (two strata).** The corpus reaches Born by two derivations, kept deliberately separate. The *operational* stratum (the Gleason-class argument, formalised as the import `busch_effect_gleason`) forces Born from effect-additivity given the formalism, with no configuration space, covering arbitrary effects. The *ontic* stratum (LF2 → LF4) derives Born as the Fubini–Study volume ratio, with the U(N) symmetry fixing the volume; this is foundational-triple-only and Gleason-free. The shift to the ontic derivation is a **relocation of the primitive, not its elimination**: Born becomes a theorem of the posited quantum-effective sector structure (`SectorData.(π, G)` — the projection onto the sector and its U(N) symmetry; see [`AXIOMS.md`](AXIOMS.md) §3.3) rather than an independent probability postulate. Honest hierarchy: Born-as-a-volume-ratio is dischargeable now for projective measurements *modulo* that sector posit, which in turn rests on the deterministic dynamics — and in every concrete instance the flow is currently the identity, so the dynamics layer is not yet exercised (the deepest open question, calling for further theoretical development). **General POVMs are now covered geometrically too** (the Naimark-dilation route, see the POVM table below): the (non-projective) POVM Born weight is a sum of Fubini–Study volumes on a dilated `Σ' = ℂℙ^{N·|ι|−1}`, unconditionally and Gleason-free, with `canonicalNaimark` supplying the dilation for every POVM — at the cost of enlarging the posited sector structure by the ancilla.

**POVM extension (Naimark dilation — the ontic Born derivation for general measurements, 2026-06-03):**

| Theorem | File | Mathematical meaning | Axioms |
|---|---|---|---|
| `POVM`, `weights_sum_eq_normSq` | `LF2/POVM.lean` | The POVM type (effects summing to `I`); the Born weights `pᵢ(ψ)=⟨ψ,Eᵢψ⟩` sum to `‖ψ‖²`. | none |
| `NaimarkDilation`, `born_transfer` | `LF4/POVMDilation.lean` | The dilation data (isometry `V`, `Vᴴ Πᵢ V = Eᵢ`); the Born transfer `⟨ψ,Eᵢψ⟩ = ⟨Vψ, Πᵢ Vψ⟩` onto the projective surface. | none |
| `povm_born_eq_block_sum` | `LF4/POVMVolume.lean` | POVM weight = `∑ₙ` dilated computational-basis (rank-1) Born weights over the `i`-th ancilla block. | none |
| `povm_born_eq_dilated_volume` | `LF4/POVMVolume.lean` | **POVM Born weight = a sum of Fubini–Study volumes** of the dilated barycentric cells on `Σ'=ℂℙ^{N·\|ι\|−1}` (via the `piLpCongrLeft` reindex + `bornRegion_fs_measure`). | none |
| `povm_born_frequency_volume` | `LF4/POVMVolume.lean` | **The observable capstone**: i.i.d. FS trials on `Σ'` ⟹ the `i`-th POVM outcome's empirical frequency → `⟨ψ,Eᵢψ⟩`. Carving-free, Gleason-free. | none |
| `canonicalNaimark`, `naimarkV_isom`, `naimarkV_pullback` | `LF4/POVMNaimark.lean` | **Existence**: the canonical Naimark dilation from the CFC square roots `√Eᵢ = cfc Real.sqrt Eᵢ` inhabits `NaimarkDilation P` for **every** POVM — making the volume/frequency results unconditional. | none |

This makes the ontic Born derivation cover **arbitrary quantum measurements**, not just projective (von Neumann) ones, with `busch_effect_gleason` fully off the ontic path — it survives only as the operational-stratum statement. Plan and honesty ledger: `specs/povm-plan.md`. Genericity hypothesis (`hpos`): the dilated state `ψ'` has no vanishing amplitude.

### LF3 (singlet kernel, pointer-sector decomposition, empirical chain)

`LF3_main_theorem` and `LF3_finite_leakage_theorem` cite **only** the foundational triple. The six chain capstones are now **foundational-triple-only** too (re-routed off Busch, 2026-06-02): `weight_eq_P_st` routes the chain bridge through the Busch-free `OP_p_at_jointEig_eq_P_st_direct`. `busch_effect_gleason` is retained only for the operational-stratum statements.
